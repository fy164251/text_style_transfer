When forty winters shall beseige thy brow, And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, Thy youth's proud livery, thyself is sure to see, Will be a tatter'd weed, thou clinchest thyself in thy beauty, thy youth'll discern in thy beauty, thyself clearly marked out in thine eyes, thyself sure to see,6 No wonder thy beauties were doubted. How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, If thou couldst answer'This fair child of mine Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'Proving his beauty by succession thine! This were to be new made when thou art old, And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
