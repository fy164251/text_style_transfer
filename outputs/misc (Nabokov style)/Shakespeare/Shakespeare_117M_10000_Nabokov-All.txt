From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beauty's rose might never die, and should be only frightful and fleeting, His tender heir might bear his memory: But thou, my fair, not everything is lost: thine eyes see, but thine eyes see, Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel, Making a famine where abundance lies, Policating deceit and a millennium of shame: But I who am only a light in mortal life shall see the world through the stained glass of art, Within thine own bud buriest thy content And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding. Thus, dear, best of all, Remember the sweetness of thine own gravestone that I shall see next.
