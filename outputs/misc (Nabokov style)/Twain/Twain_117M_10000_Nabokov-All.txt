At first I hated the school, but then I simply could not stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and played Norvellian, and then my contempt rolled over in elation. And now I really donâ€™t know why I kept going to school. I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways, too, and they war n't so raspy on me. Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory.
