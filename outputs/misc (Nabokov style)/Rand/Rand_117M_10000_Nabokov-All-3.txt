She sat at the window of the train, sighing as she did that, but then she got up and move to the seat opposite her and sat there too, reclining. The window creaked as it swung into motion, the pane of the window half opened, and there was darkness again, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running straight, now stretched out to an angle, above the knee, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and even more so because of the comical expression on her face. The calves of her high-heeled shoes were bare, and her bag was full of sand, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. She put on the shoes, and the collar turned out to be long. A sweep of brown hair fell back, touching her left shoulder. Her forehead, cheek and all of her arms were those of a babushka, blush seeping into the spectrum of her cheeks, a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. She straightened, fidgeted, brushed her bare arms with her handkerchief, and then her hand reached down, as if just barely, on her knees, for she had grabbed something and her face was quivering over a woman's body. In the familiarity of the room, she looked up, relaxed. It was a symphony of triumph. The air was warmly flowing music, notes spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, and the closer they came, the more distinct and overwhelming became their conviction that if they attained. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and immediately the air, having at once filled with a tempestuous sigh. The sonorous note of the sound grew and filled with its ominous premonition, but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain in its every pronouncement. It was the song of an immense deliverance.
