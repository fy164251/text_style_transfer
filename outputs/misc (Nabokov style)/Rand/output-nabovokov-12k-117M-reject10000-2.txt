She sat at the window of the train, brooding, shaking her head, shaking herself, and could not quite make one's feet rest on the floor. The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the empty darkness, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running straight, now developed lateral instep at the base of the heel, accompanied by a small elastic at the tip; it, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly fitting the contours of her profile. She wore the most expensive dress in the world, the most expensive shoes, the most expensive mouth, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. The most extravagant part, she wore under her black dress: a fur collar. A sweep of brown hair fell back, lowered, down, above her shoulders. Her forehead, with its dignified visor, was kid-face, and the pout of the fattish corns made her look as if she were stroking a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. Her hands encased in the black straps of her coat did not move, but she constantly freed one leg to push forward, as if she were unconscious of her own body. The other, totally silent part of her was rocking slightly, with a faint humming. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes passed, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, and as such they were utterly beyond consciousness. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and at the same time coming empty. The only sound was the coming of breathless, muffled room, but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain, in fact, there was nothing at all. It was the song of an immense deliverance.
