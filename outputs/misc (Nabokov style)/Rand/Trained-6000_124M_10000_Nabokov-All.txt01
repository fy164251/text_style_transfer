She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, and listened, bent over the seat. Her long. The window frame trembled with the speed of her motion, the blind man had gone, and a black, cloudless sky drifted without a shadow, and Ganin saw, through the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. Her leg, revealing a sheen of marbled velvet, its long line running straight, over an arched instep, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and somehow it all reminded her of a landscape. She wore a high-heeled coat but was a little too expensive, her slender skirt keeping her out of reach; and the curve of her pale caramel nose and the slender, nervous body. A little further back she was clad in a gray overcoat with a pleated collar, her legs rounded so that the hat could be quite off. A sweep of brown hair fell back, from behind her head. The contours of her corpulent back, with its angular shape and the long, thin, velvet folds along her jaw, reminded one of an alt-alt-alt-air, a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. Her bag was folded in a pocket, her shoes unfastened, her arms placed wide apart, her palm crossed, and unfeminine, violet-scented, on the other hand, from her mouth to her eyes body and that it was a woman's body. There she sat, slightly swaying. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they went on rising, and they were spoken of the form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. The live, elemental trumpet was sung, with a self-penned chimes, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the comfort of an alchemic soliloquy. It swept space clean, and it had the joy of being lifted. This was its whole sound, and it stood out highly in the swift hum of the music. Oh, it was splendid, bursting with life, laughter the discovery that there was no ugliness or senseless pain. It was purer than the nearest song.
