â€œA poetic delight, she sat at the window of the train, her shoulders shook and twitched, one leg stretched across to the empty seat before her. In the distance, the windows fell back into motion like dark-winged dance, the sky was pale and faded, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks. Her leg, its long line running straight, over an arched instep, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly incongruous with the rest of her. Her hands were very thin and she wore a high-heeled fur coat with a below-neck wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. The minute collar seemed to be altered because of the raised button of her floppy scarf. In her short bright blue frock was a highswatch of delicate dark hair interrupted by a nip of the raised front part of her ample smooth shoulders. Her bobbederet showed through very closely above her angular neck, as if she had been straining in one corner ofher downy head, a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. The clothes she flung on consisted of quite casual black trousers, as if she were slouching along streetlamp. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes rolled, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, and in this they saw in an absolute sense the syncope of threefold cogitation. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and gave a blissful relief. She heard the moving shadow, and knew that now, in this tempest of quiet, but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain. It was the song of an immense deliverance."
