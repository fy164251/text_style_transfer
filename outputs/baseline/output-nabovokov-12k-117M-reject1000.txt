She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, one leg stretched across to the empty seat before her. The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the motionless blackness of the room, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running straight, over an arched instep, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly relatable in the low-slung ranks of her. She wore a battered camel's hair coat that had been expensive, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. The coat was clean-cut too, worn into the sleek collar that clung to her neck. A sweep of brown hair fell back, down, down, over her shoulders. Her forehead, above the sun-dappled asphalt, was smudgy and plump, and the wing of her nose, a glossy dark-orange, was exactly shaped as her lips, small stern Plebeian nose thrust below, with downward curved mouth. Her long muscular hands were free, her pink mane kept catching the rays, and the muscles, and the muscles of her hands continued to embrace, as if she suddenly slipped into a woman's body. 'And once?' she asked, nodding in silence. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose.
