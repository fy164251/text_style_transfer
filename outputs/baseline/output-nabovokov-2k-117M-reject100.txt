She sat at the window of the train, her hands clasped over her face, her eyes blinking, and stretched her legs so that her heels clacked against the train floor. The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the railing creaked, and there was a flash in the darkness, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. 

Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running straight, had almost collapsed, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, and had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly familiar to her. She wore a battered camel's hair coat that had been expensive, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. The front of her coat looked grayish. A sweep of brown hair fell back, down and over her shoulder. Her arms and legs were of a coarse sheen, the corners of her lips were asymmetrical, a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. The bright red of her dress gave her away slightly as if she were wearing a little black dresser across her shoulders, and a small slit next to her neck indicated that her blood was licking a woman's body. She was listening to the music. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they were the consciousness of the whole of the world. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort. The sound was strange, but perhaps it was something much more than human, and spoke in laughing astonishment of the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain. It was the song ofan immense deliverance. 


She went with the flow, and next moment became ready to surrender completely — to forget everything and just permit yourself to feel. She was taken away for quite a while, moaning softly, trying to remember something. She was right, under the music, she heard the sound of train wheels. They knocked in an even rhythm, every fourth knock accented, as if stressing a conscious purpose. And then she heard them again. She put her head under the collar and listened, thinking: This is why the wheels have to be kept going, and they must be going. She mistook the clatter of her own voice for the rhythmic clatter of music but she knew that it was written by Richard Halley. She recognized the violence and the magnificent intensity. She enjoyed composing and writing; it was the same thing, except that now she wrote in a rhythmic, loving, lyrical way... '. She did not know whether she was hearing a frill symphony orchestra or only the theme of a desolate country road; she did not know whether she was dreaming or merely imagining strings. She seemed to feel a faint longing to find Halley's work, through all the years of his long struggle, and see what it was all about, when fame struck him suddenly and knocked him out. She did not know exactly what to think, listening to the symphony — had it been the goal of his struggle? She had heard music, and was glad that he made an attempt to find happiness, wrote phrases that promised it, broken bitsof melody that started but never quite reached it; when Richard Halley wrote this, he... She sat straight and began to sob. When did Richard Halley write this?
