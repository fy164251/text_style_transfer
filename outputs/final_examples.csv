0,"She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, one leg stretched across to the empty seat before her. The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the pane hung over empty darkness, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line runningstraight, over an arched instep, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly incongruous with the rest of her. She wore a battered camel's hair coat that had been expensive, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body.  The coat collar was raised to the slanting brim of her hat. A sweep of brown hair fell back, almost touching the line of her shoulders. Her face was made of angular planes, the shape of her mouth clear-cut, a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. She kept her hands in the coat pockets, her posture taut, as if she resented immobility, and unfeminine, as if she were unconscious of her own body and that it was a woman's body. She sat listening to the music. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort. Only a faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped, but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain, and there never had had to be. It was the song of an immense deliverance.",orig
1,"She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, one leg stretched across to the empty seat before her. The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the blackness of space, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running straight, over an arched instep, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly relatable in the low-slung ranks of her. She wore a battered camel's hair coat that had been expensive, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. The coat was clean-cut too, worn into the sleek collar that clung to her neck. A sweep of brown hair fell back, down, down, over her shoulders. Her forehead, above the sun-dappled asphalt, was smudgy and plump, and the wing of her nose, a glossy dark-orange, was exactly shaped as her lips, small stern Plebeian nose thrust below, with downward curved mouth. Her long legs were free, her pink mane kept catching the rays, and the muscles of her hands continued to embrace, as if she suddenly slipped into a woman's body. The silence got broken. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose.",Nabokov
2,"She sat at the window of the train for half a minute, and as she looked up, she stretched one leg across to the empty seat in front of her. The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the unnerveness of the table amidst the scattered glasses, and the distressing tones of the glass pressed against the glass as luminous streaks obtruded the view. Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running straight, from the ankle to the fore-foot, to the tip of a foot in a glide, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly incongruous with the rest of her. She was a scantily shaven woman: her hair was very short but expensively cut, her face was a little hoary and attached to a rather pensive, nervous body. The coat collar was raised to the slanting yellow humbug of her hat. A sweep of brown hair fell back, affording a quick view of her face. Her hair was striking, as if unsubdued by ill-timed gravity, and almost turned into a veil against her face, her sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. She put one hand tied behind her face, and her heart leaped against the stomach with sudden feeling, as the cottony, trembling hand was about to embrace body her woman's body. She was in a reverie, as he entered the room. It was a symphony of triumph. The Tilneys were at the instrument; they determined, boldly among themselves they were the rising stars, they were the lights of the chambers, where the utmost importance was the form of upward motion, the perfection they encumbered, to examine and express themselves in all their grandeur as if they had been conscious of it. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading over the whole room. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean. There was a feeling from which the music had escaped, and spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain, and there never had had to be. It was the sound of a great pianoforte.",Austen
3,"Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.",orig
4,"Elizabeth listened in silence, but then understood that this was a deliberate lie; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, she discerned in her a deceptive, though quite reasonable, form of reflection, and not only because she was concealing her ineptitude to keep up with the jol. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, but parched; not easily swayed by carnal particularities; not indifferent minds when it came to but proud and conceited. Their meeting with everybody was very warm and well-wishing; and their smiling faces, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. The greater part of their city consisted of solidly cottoned Estotians; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.",Nabokov
5,"In the meanwhile, Monsieur continued his route with an air at once so melancholy and so majestic, that he certainly would have attracted the attention of spectators, if spectators there had been; but the good citizens of Blois could not pardon Monsieur for having chosen their gay city for an abode in which to indulge melancholy at his ease, and as often as they caught a glimpse of the illustrious ennuye, they stole away gaping, or drew back their heads into the interior of their dwellings, to escape the soporific influence of that long pale face, of those watery eyes, and that languid address; so that the worthy prince was almost certain to find the streets deserted whenever he chanced to pass through them.",orig
6,"In the meanwhile, Monsieur continued his route with an air at once ardent and melancholy, and I suppose it gave him a thrill of recognition that I doubt it would be in the course of the of spectators; but the good citizens of Blois could not pardon Monsieur for having chosen their gay city for an abode in which to indulge melancholy and oppress him, and as often as they caught a glimpse of his manipulation, they stole away gaping, or drew back their heads into the interior deals of citizens, to escape the soporific influence of that long-dressed hoodlum with purplish wrinkles and flaming cheekbones, and blue eyes, and that languid address; so that the worthy prince was almost certain to find the streets deserted whenever he chanced to glance at them.",Nabokov
