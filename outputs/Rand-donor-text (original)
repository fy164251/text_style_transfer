She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, one leg stretched across to the empty seat
before her. The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the pane hung over empty
darkness, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while.

Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running straight, over an arched
instep, to the tip of a foot in a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in
the dusty train car and oddly incongruous with the rest of her. She wore a battered camel's hair coat
that had been expensive, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. The coat collar was
raised to the slanting brim of her hat. A sweep of brown hair fell back, almost touching the line of her
shoulders. Her face was made of angular planes, the shape of her mouth clear-cut, a sensual mouth
held closed with inflexible precision. She kept her hands in the coat pockets, her posture taut, as if
she resented immobility, and unfeminine, as if she were unconscious of her own body and that it was
a woman's body. She sat listening to the music. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up,
they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward
motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. It was a
sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the
tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort. Only a
faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped, but spoke in laughing
astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain, and there never had had to be. It was
the song of an immense deliverance.
