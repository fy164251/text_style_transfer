They are making a journey of this size and people are making journeys of this size. I am going insane.”\n",

      "“No, thank you. The one I have got on is still living with you in your apartment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know better,” said the woman, glancing around at the others with a dark smile. “She’s here to see you. She likes to see you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a curious woman with a strange sensuous quality about her face. With this face I knew that this was the secret of her being and that she alone had been responsible for my life. In my mind, I could imagine her at work, at home, at her room, with the black cat waiting for me behind the door, and the dreamy girl in white with the pink eyes seemed to be sitting like that too—her own bedroom among other dreams—and it was thus with the same intention that I resolved to take advantage of that subtle gift of hers, my mistress’s magic shade, I was already half-closer when I heard her lovely voice, now far off, as if I had glimpsed a secret vista of perfect simplicity—and again the light, transparent shade would recede, again it would recede, yet again I would have the shadow of my dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening during the morning I spent a most agonizing effort to stop the dreamer from falling to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, however, my inner pencil (the one I was forced to use) managed to make its way into a special drawer where I found in my turn two large, hard-looking pencils.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an effort to set off at once the clocks, I put them into the lock of some wooden case on which the light went through the drawers which were quite apart, so as to concentrate on them at once while I kept atoning by putting the pencils into my pocket. After putting them all under the window of the nursery, my dream continued with a kind of dreamy play.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night her father and mother passed across the passage at a slight angle. At every passing pass a clock struck with an occasional hiccup and its operator would switch from clock to night-time sleeper. Sometimes, on the eve of the next day’s work, the same little clock would suddenly ring with some distant click as if it were playing with something; another tick, louder still, would immediately close upon the ticking in the forepart of the corridor, its shadow crossing the threshold of my bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, upon seeing all that I put on my nightdress and ran away, my father and a shortish footman overtook me. I was ashamed to stand on that narrow footman’s toes and to be seen to the left of my bare foot, where there was a tiny moth, with dim red specks on its forehead and a pale, pale-green crown. I was not ashamed at all at all at that moment, for I had never noticed my step, and it was only while lying there that I began to notice my step. I could not see anything to the left of the footman, though the other had the same dark-grey head and was thinking of a rather amusing thought. The footman had a black face and a white beard. From under the back of my hand I examined the top of the nightcap and its holes. It turned out, however, that beneath the white beard I had cut a little hole for the moth’s head; I was about to make a repair of its head. The hole grew small but still there.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was entering and leaving that room, I heard my step softly approaching, very softly hearkening to me. It was my father, but in the course of conversation he changed position, and the conversation moved away. I could not tell whether the man was my step or the moth. I was afraid of hurting him on the way or of hurting my father, as he happened to be standing on some distant step, with away his gloves. I saw, however, my step, my nightcap, my night-cap; and, after a quarter of a minute had passed, a little dark-haired lady coming toward me, the night air still fresh. The ghost of that lady gradually came to life, and again this lady appeared. She was a kind of lady with a kind of very thin lips, but with long lashes and a very coy smile. Her face was so black, so gray, that I could not tell whether it had been in my nightcap or not, and again the lady came.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recalled several things when the chance encounter occurred. I had known her for years, and I knew she would appear again. Perhaps, a chance encounter might lead me to become her lover. Perhaps I would find a nice close-\n",

      "“In a moment, in a moment, I’ll turn this book upside down,” said Victor. With a gentle blow she threw the book upside down and, with another gentle blow, she began sobbing, and again she sobbed, and again she sobbed, and again she sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat next to Victor on the edge of the bed, on the edge of the chair … and her legs, at her waist, slowly, quite slowly, were bare. She bent over her half-naked little sister and asked them to stop crying.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I think it is time to begin, Felix, to grow strong,” he kept repeating at a frightening pace. For a long time he kept sobbing, and then suddenly he would suddenly stop sobbing and say: “All right, all right, all right.…”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, Felix, all right,” he kept repeating, and there was another beating and the book which he had kept sobbing in kept being laid on the edge of the bed.\n",

Don’t you think that perhaps I can be good enough? What will she say about love, art, music, her childhood—all that will be left to me?

The evening drizzled on the windowsill was a splendid, deep, bright fire! He had lost his head and was about to fall with a roar forever, but the silence was like burning hair, which is trying to get across a window. He watched, like a grown-up, the fire smoke rising and falling from the chimney—and it was a queer sight—a man with a pistol in his grip. He stood there, holding onto the chimney, as if to watch how the smoke would billow, or how, with every stroke, it would rush to his face. A thick black mound rose over the white water, and a silvery cloud rose higher, and then a broad grayish depression appeared.\n",

      ": the sound of her throat-clearing. She said: 'Here's the box, you won't find it lying around'. 'You know perfectly well I have something to give you, but now you know...' 'I think....' said the maid.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, my poor darling! There's no hurry. Let me in.' She turned to the door and opened it. 'In?' said the maid and went in. 'In the box... It's empty.' The box was covered with a newspaper. She pressed her hands against her temples, groped for the edge and found it. 'And here's another,' she said. 'This is very queer, very queer, queer, a piece of newspaper, don't you think —' 'No, it's not a hole,' said the maid. 'In fact, it's inside, and this will be very, very amusing to look in if you do. You see, I know you've just been in a meeting, aren't you? and as I know your name is in no danger place, in no — —\n",
      "\n",
      "not in any danger — — and so on. Yes, I am very gay.' 'Hullo,' interrupted the maid; 'there you are. Good-bye. Oh, you two are asleep.' 'I'll come in in a minute,' she said, drawing out slowly, 'but first we'll find a room. I shall bring you the keys and they won't turn up this spring. Oh, it's a trap and you'll be dead in a minute.' 'But I need a lift!' said the maid. 'What can I do with this card, why do all those things? Oh, here is a lift. Here's a lift with my card.' 'No, no, there's plenty,' said the maid, still trying to hold the door locked. 'Now you've heard a whole lot,' she went on, 'and we think you'll find myself some room next spring in no matter whether you take care not to get down first either the card room or the elevator. Come, stay here till you're told I'm gone but do let me see yourself out, because I don't think I have left all this lying around. I think this will be the last room you live in, for I'll be back from my trip in minutes.' There was silence, and the door slammed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now, you may leave, or let's go for good —' said the maid, and locked the door and opened another. There. Her card. The picture with the hole in the back was of an infant girl. She was bare-shouldered, her legs were spread; her hair was extraordinarily short and sleek — and all the round about were of the same make as those on the sofa: the slender, round back, the round shoulders and arms — the same hair comb, the same hair necklace. Her name was Rosaline.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are you happy to know that we won't be seeing each other for some time? This is so very nice, but …' 'Is it really true —' said the maid. 'That I am quite sure you expect us not to see each other for quite a while now?' 'Yes, this is a little queer,' said Ember in a low voice. 'Does it not seem to you that today at this time we shall have been at Biarritz together? Oh, yes, I know all about it — but there's nothing to write about. And that's the fact.' 'Yes, but you'll get into trouble,' her voice went on and on, 'I'm afraid I'll have to ask my friends you and your husband — we have a whole' — 'But it would be very rude of you to spoil things, to talk about their past as if they were never my life.' 'No,' said Ember and again attempted to speak, but this attempt made him slouch, he tried to tell something that he had just said, he tried to remember how those black thick lips had just found his — he was afraid that this impostor would cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he persisted for a long time in trying to keep his things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doorbell rang; the maid ushered him in.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sorry,' said Ember with a jerk of his shoulder. 'I'm awfully sorry about this,' he went on, 'I don't know where I'll be after all. I haven't thought very much about it, really, not really. I don't want any trouble about it. I had a rather good reason for going away — only I don't quite think I'll ever come back here again, the country — you were always so pleasant. You were like a good brother to me, you were just as happy as you were in childhood! Well, if that's what my —'\n",

      "Now, as to my little friend’s new clothes and not to the way he is supposed to look in a shabby suit, I must not dwell too deeply on that special kind of shock (sucrifice) I can see coming—oh no, no, I never feel so stunned. The only thing that really thrilled him in those last days was the news of my poor little Miss Pratt’s death; but he was quick to pay no attention whatsoever to Miss Pratt’s death, as both of them had spent a whole weekend in California. At our last dinner, together with the three ladies (who, in the case of Miss Pratt, might not know I was deaf and rowed), the whole family had been away, and now I felt he had better believe they would not come back, as the possibility of an interview was highly unlikely to bother him any more. At the end of that trip I had decided to leave for the hospital as soon as I was a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime I had a letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, I learnt, a short business letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, he demanded I give him a copy of my letter. That demanded I did not copy it. I answered that I signed it and mailed it. Nothing more was necessary. He signed it too. I received the rest of the letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered what the letter said. I answered that it said it would say if we chose to see him in person this Friday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "At seven thirty my salary increased by one penny as far as Mrs. Pratt was concerned, and for the same as he was paying me for the betterment of the house. We went to the hotel. In the morning Mrs. Pratt asked me what he would do if she had to see me in person; I answered that she would just buy me a new suit and bring me my things. He asked me to put on his old dress and hat and go. I went with good cheer and was a little nervous. He wanted to know if I was a good dog. I explained I was, for a moment, his pet. It was a little chilly out. I got out of bed and set out for the library. It was a Sunday and everybody was leaving this morning around three. I was, of course, in full view of the astonished guests, and this was getting late. As I was leaving he exclaimed “No,” I was not in a cab. It was a wonder I could not get out of my miserable state (no doubt I had no more than a ten dollar purse with me) and into my favorite shelter. I groped for the open suitcase in the hall, and found there my very own suit. It was dark in the room I occupied. I looked out of the mirror and turned to look at the book which I had dropped by some time ago. This suit, although obviously of the utilitarian type, contained (I hoped) such additional advantages, namely the convenient material of suede-soledear along its lower sleeves! Its colors: brown, dark-tau, pale-blond. The color scheme was, I hoped, very pleasing to me. I was about to read its spine when it turned and looked around. For a moment it froze. I looked at the book’s spine as if I were looking at an abyss. It was, however, looking, so I thought, at the inner spine. After reading, I glanced at the spine again and again, and this time it seemed to me as though everything in the world was connected with the spinal cord. What did the lawyer mean? Should I tell somebody? Should I leave it alone or let it lapse and look? Whatever my own opinions of the suit were, I found it repulsive. I was once again in a different country, this time with no income; and I was not even in the least worried lest something—possibly a suspiciously large, perhaps even bulging, object—might throw me, in my own way, out of the happy marriage I had begun to form. I found other means of dealing with matters as I left the hotel. All were in good order. The lawyer said he was still awaiting the results of a second test which I wished to call tomorrow. I did not go on too deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I know how it worked out. After passing a test I suddenly remembered I was being examined. Under the heading of general knowledge arose a brief, ponderous sentence: If I had a wife I ought to marry her. There followed another little silence, and my thoughts wandered. Yes. There was some business to be settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mrs. Pratt was told to see me in the afternoon. A little while later she accompanied me as she was wont to do on businesslike occasions. When I had reached her door, I gave a small shove for which I felt, not unlike a little shiver, as I entered, as if through a sick night\n",

From an adjacent street he went down to the fourth floor and after a couple of feet, through the glass door, his brown silk shoes and gray felt boots, which he had seen on a fat woman, were ushered into a waiting room. And then, not so fast, a man who looked exactly as I am from two stories above, entered carrying with him a suit of clothes that he had given him for a meeting last spring, and also a suitcase with a handful of old things not fitting in at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked through the narrow window to the left and then saw the second-floor window and the front entrance hall. He noticed a pair of trousers and a hat in the hallway, and the window was immediately locked, and he turned away. On the floor below a pink-tufted man with a darkish complexion immediately took down an insect that had crawled onto his knee. Then a girl whose face he had seen before and remembered it well, a very short-legged beauty, appeared in the distance, behind him.\n",

      "At the bottom of the stairs he met the lady who had vanished long ago—perhaps because of a job interview. And that same day he also saw her again. He reached her at the railway station and asked if her husband was here. He had been led out of a room, which was not intended for guests, and he asked again. She answered in a loud and polite voice, shaking her head and putting her finger to his mouth, looking at him with an expression of childish curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, it’s you,” she said. “I’m afraid you have a lot of troubles. You and I will manage and find a decent decent abode, and eventually you will find it. Yes, yes, but I’m a poor woman, poor, weak woman, and that’s it. Come along with me.”\n",

      "Her bright pink head was lowered, her lips were pursed, and her eyes sparkled. The lady’s large, warm hands clasped and checked the listless itinerant visitor. He looked at what he was about to take a notebook from the couch, and in a flash of inspiration drew an abyss, another staircase, a third, a fourth, and the fourth, and then he saw again the lady’s face, her hand in his pocket, and his heart was bursting with happiness, and the smile on her lips was genuine and genuine, and her small, light-blue eyes were burning. And he saw how nicely her face resembled the one that the host had cast off his coat and walked out of the room with her hands on his heart. It was only a trifle enlivening and somehow my memory is no longer sharp—but the girl does not work; it is a pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "His heart felt lighter but the day remained unchanged, so that now it was difficult to see how he could ever again recapte c his love. For an instant he saw the expression of his mother’s cold eyes, her dull, frightened eyes; he had the sensation of looking at something, the quality of fate, fate itself. His thoughts now moved to his wife, who was dining, and presently he heard the abrupt wail of a horse’s hoof, and then came the sound of a run, the sound of her retreating in slow, slow motion.\n",

For a while I thought with a slight shudder—this wasn’t about her, this was about the people whom she had made fools of herself: she was crazy, she felt the pressure of fame, the fame of fame. And what she saw of herself, the nonsense she made about herself, the ridiculous, impossible, nonsensical absurdity of her fame, the absurdity of its forming the necessary background, she took down in her thought a sheet of newspaper or a piece of chalk with which she had hastily wiped her face, but at least not too hastily.\n",

      "\n",
      "She was still on that particular evening, in another country. With the help of another I could see her through two or three mirror-like projections. I started to walk back and forth with her to the hotel. She never stopped to thank me and she made herself comfortable before my door. From another room upstairs came voices which for a moment became a remote, almost human conversation. I could hear her telling people to get out of bed, and pressing the button—the same key the old I had left on my dress coat—into a large and very dark door that banged in the night. I entered an ivory drawing gallery. A woman was talking loudly and unexpectedly about some project she had made for a local artist, a bald-headed man with a fat neck, and a yellowish bandage around his shoulder. I saw him up close throwing a ball in a corner, and the shadows of the shadows on the ground were very eerie. There were flowers in bloom. She walked past me, looking through a book. “That’s enough, Villa Disgwinia,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my room I made my way to another drawing gallery. I found it a most eerie feeling. A man in a velvet coat was looking through another coat in which the folds were red like wax. I looked in again and sat down with open mouth. It was a gentleman who appeared, and we were talking as clearly as two people seeing a hand. This gentleman was holding a dark-framed book which had been put in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look,” he said, putting the book aside. “I need the drawings in order to travel. I was having one too. You are the boss, are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know what you are thinking,” I answered. “You really are.…”\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that, I took his book away and explained that for me, according to his project, I had to “collect my thoughts”—that was my profession. In point of fact, I could collect them into my own head. I did it by noticing the movements of all my moods. When I went out at night, I went out to look at the road where a stone wall stands still. When I went out of town, I went out in the night. And when I returned, it seemed to me that it had all been settled, collected, and my old job was complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must collect my thoughts,” I said softly, “I must collect them into my own brain. So let me see what it is I don’t do, I don’t want to, I don’t know when to stop, what to go on with, what to do with. Aha, that’s torture, that’s torture. Give me some other job. I’ve had enough of that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then (as the legend goes), she was in the house, talking to another dear woman. It is very clear from what I gather that in mid-July 1936, at that dreadful pause in our cohabitation (which began with a sigh and progressed with a clatter) she consented to have her last son, then three or four, whisked away to live with her husband and mother in an asylum for the mentally ill. A few days later, upon returning from the “office,” she left with a hundred coins in her purse which in that state she had forgotten about; then two more, then a dozen little pendants—that is, I think I collected eight in all—clutching her hips among a heap of little sacks and pulling out at last the top of the window sill, where there was a faint whiff of stale perfume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards came insomnia, I.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not sure whether or not to endure that sound, that slow sound, which in fact she did not hear, she could not accept, for the time being, as a slight indulgence; and her usual rhythm, to the rhythm of her own self, changed, to that of that other, whose rhythm she had always known and feared. The night also came on and, in the silence, there dwelt in its depths a longish fume which had reddened at the edges and then had acquired a certain rich brilliancy and longed to endow it with the aura of solitude and peace which she so avidly sought. That was why, a little after midnight, that eerie sense of solitude which had been so characteristic of her in childhood, suddenly went away—or so quickly that she wondered if indeed it had ever happened before in her life, which had been so short of fancies, so smooth and plain.\n",

It was like looking at a blacksmith in a white smelly shop. I felt something hot spreading from his hand, something shivery, something thick, like the down of a heavy pear and now, without warning, the whole shadeless world was about to fall to pieces.… A great rush of excitement suddenly burst through one’s brain, and I heard an extraordinary—and terrifying—fact.… Oh, what nonsense, what haste! At first I had thought it all had started on the idea of some distant, ruddy day and had no idea where, nor if … But I had mistaken it for a vague Sunday, with a dark and thundery rain, and then it dawned upon me once again that it was an I-would-rather-not-destroy-anybody-than-people-would-rather-to-destroy-a-great-wave.… And then I felt something violent rush from my chest and I heard the familiar whir, a strong, strong yuccal sound. And now, just as if I were descending through a trembling fog, the familiar beat thundered forth, dispersing again into this unknown abyss, and now, at last, I could see with my own eyes the dark-patched half-collapsed house, leaving only the white silhouettes of the white silhouettes of the silhouettes of the silhouettes of the characters in the light.… “All this sounds frightening!

My feet were wet from running so fast, my toes were hot from running on them—how can one run on all fours now?—and from the dining room there were people—my wife, a pleasant, attentive old lady, and an old man, who constantly greeted me. Only a moment ago, in the drawing room, I had had people by like-minded friends, and now it was my turn. There was also a tall count, with a sharp nose and a sharp jaw, and the tall count kept on walking all the time, now, when I had made him look subhuman, now, when I had brought back those people for a moment. All this in sudden appearance had its absurd side. For this I had to perform a miracle.\n",

I froze motionless, afraid to tear, afraid of falling down one by one onto the floor by any moving parts, of letting out a breath of hot humid air. At the far end of the room there were three tables, one chair was standing in the middle, and a table rod at the end, leaning against the wall, was lying on top of the table with its front panel gently creasing inside out and leaving a black blotch across the lower edge. At this end a nurse was hurrying toward me, with her legs in tawny lather—and her shadow settled on an abyssal cliff beyond which flowed a winding forest, forming a kind of marsh, then subsiding again as the wood faded. And then, as if nothing had happened, a huge cloud clung tightly to the window shade—and this came to a close—and that cloud passed as if striding on its tortoise-shell bottom toward the dark silhouetted top of the cloud.\n",

      "In the course of that night he went up in the morning to his office, where, he said, he was meeting a friend, and with him, several times a day, a quiet, elderly, silent man who seemed more interested in the future of an ancient firm than in furniture, just as Olga than in sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that house, between the Stadt and the Museum, he sat upon a chair fashioned out of polished tin, and, leaning on his heel, walked in the company of several elderly museum visitors. Their eyes lingered on him for a moment, then fanned out again. Olga’s husband, a slender man, wore a starched collar and tie, and his gray umbrella was ruddy on the sun. The door to his study was wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "A door flew open by itself. Inside, the night seemed even stranger. As soon as dawn came, a black-haired maid unlocked the door in a low, high-pitched voice, without even closing the door behind her, and, bending alone, groped for her room. From the entrance hall came an impatient clatter. The maid hurried in pursuit of the man. At once the room became dark and creak and creak. The panting, sweating young maid, who had been dousing a bucket in buckets and singing loudly, made the impassive man’s muff as if she were an actress. When he was alone, the maid said with a smile, “Oh, he’s staying with his mistress here.” She led him out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid made him a cup of tea. He fancied he recognized with a flash when the tiny hand that had stopped the night’s motion was fastening—something light and swift. The sound of the door opened, and he saw the dark little hall with the glass dome above the entrance hall. And there, between the vestibule and the gaudy, gaudy-haired poplars, sat an old German general, clad in a yellow jersey over his dinner jacket. He sat down after having cleared his throat a couple of times, and was now pacing around the table, muttering under his breath. Suddenly an old fellow with blue-rimmed glasses appeared. He was squatting in his hammock, arms folded on his chest. Behind him a pale-pale, slightly dark-haired stranger came up to and greeted him with the sound of an unknown tune. He wore an English cap. The general kept turning his head to stare at him. Then he turned back to Gustav and went on. “What’s happened to the Waldens?” asked Gustav, trying to out-shake every other question. “There, there,” whispered another.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Gustav stood there, glancing at the darkness above him, he felt the sweet tingle of a heart attack. Then he saw his wife. Her face remained blank, her dress did not move, her eyes did not linger. He recalled that once, when she used to come to home with a suitcase full of things, he had the nightmare sensation of her sitting like a corpse in front of her, looking into the dark night and looking at all the passers-by, but not necessarily at herself. Why did it occur to him that she had changed since then? Perhaps the thought of happiness was good for him, but not for life. He felt he could not cope with her, he could not live with her undistinguishable, unloved warmth—and, one moment, in his blissful lucidity, he would be ashamed to say something terrible. But on the other hand, what would happen now if she were not with him? Her silence, her cold, helpless eyes, her silence, his silence. He could not imagine exactly what would happen now, when she is gone, what would happen then? Oh, she and I shall never be alone, just like the children, one night—just like a ghost. What, she told you? (she told you) What is it, her silence? (she told you).… Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been pleasant to talk to him. At times he had made her sit up, as she frequently sat up, saying, “I do not know, my dear, she is not sick, she woke up one day without breakfast, and there she is.” And sometimes she would get up and walk away, with the same insolent and absurd question. He lived in a different world. He could not imagine with any certainty—a failure of imagination, the stench of a prison caged cell, her in prison, her in her cell, her in the various different thoughts and feelings floating through and drowning all in one’s thoughts.\n",

      "At night, having let the dream settle, he would go out of his mind without stopping. The light of his room was a pale yellow. The\n",

I was about to make myself comfortable in the parlor, but her suitcase gave on the stairs. I glanced at the magazine I had been waiting for, and found it so revolting that I jumped out of my seat, but had to wait a moment for a door leading to the bedroom, and was amazed when I found out from downstairs that the room had been prepared by a professional architect for her. It was painted a mauve-green (I am rather unfamiliar with that term) and had four buttons for multiple-l cellophane displays. I remember it having a round back, but it was painted a reddish green in the back.\n",

Her hand is in the palm, her fingers move; her face is perfectly expressionless; the four buttons are all very lightly pressed and the outline of her hand is so smooth that one edge is turned sharply at a slight angle to give a slightly off-putting look of agitation. She has begun to say, “I think I’ll read you a letter from Monsieur Blas Enfants Chamar. He’s my brother-in-law, and has just died in action, right here in this yard. He’s interested in us. He’s a Swiss citizen, I think.”\n",

      "I mentioned that I had come to check on her progress when her mother, a first-class student, returned from a trip to Saratov and found her, my young mistress, having lunch with our friends, waiting for my lady who was on the way to the cathedral.\n",

But as you will see, the rain seemed to have stopped—you see a great bright rippling against the black sky. We had a great time—you’d have thought I didn’t at all, I might have said something even to myself, when all around the houses clouds were fluttering, and so every cloud was like a misty, moist, almost transparent heaven. The trees were still thawing, but the day was still festive, having at last arrived. We enjoyed ourselves, we laughed at the jokes of misfortune, we both enjoyed comedy. And that fine rain. Oh, there it is, all sticky, all sticky, isn’t it?”\n",

      "That second night we lay in that little dark chalet which smelled of burning bogs and which was so small and light in darkness and wide in the blots of the night. It was odd, I reflected, how one could howle with so much power in one’s life and how one’s love alone could not hold it any longer. We lay alone in the chalet, in a strange, dark, misty way; you lay on your back, staring, then lightly closing one eye. At last the night turned to water, and next to it, like a blue wave, the night rose into the yard with sobs that you found strange.\n",

Our eyes, as we lay there, drifted apart and met in space among the dark objects which seemed to glide by into another world from which they come. One saw the night, a star-shaped object, moving, moving, as if just leaving its footprint on the wall like a dark drop. It floated away into the distance and there was nobody around except for two Russians (a very young relative), and a little boy, and the two of them —\n",

The star-shaped object that was flying past, and then stopped, and looked nothing more than a disc upon the glassed obelisk of the desk in which you and I lay, and the little boy was still much older — but to the very young of souls he was not even that either, he was just an ordinary little boy — a mere doll.

You could not have endured such agony, such a senseless, illusory pain. Your thoughts slithered aside in search of the most terrible thing in you, all alone beyond the bed. You groped for the bowler you had thought on mush; the spoon, the rose, the cup, the leaf on the plate — nothing. You were so frightened by everything and so miserable, you would think you were going to die, and in the depths you stayed, you would feel unbearable,\n",

      " find that there is no one else but me to blame, and I could write a whole novel about him. All right. What next? What novel? What is the next? Well, one possible explanation would do. A strange, bizarre thought struck me. Perhaps it was all a question of style. My brain, though, had long become a hub of material equipoise. In this I was living. At first, such affairs were not unfamiliar. I recall, for instance, with tender detail — a little cardboard of some kind or other, and a bit of color still protruding above the yellow of some beetle legs. I must have found this material somewhere: on the edge of some garden bench, a bit of rich, brownish wood — but I was unable to make out its label. A strange thought hung over me. In the course of my wanderings, perhaps I saw other people, perhaps I simply remembered living. Thus I gradually got into the habits of living, both in Europe and in America. Once, in Russia, I happened to be walking along a garden path, and noticed a tall man with bushy eyebrows, a light-blue, turquoise-black mustache, a round, damp, pink face — and he turned the wheel as he approached me. He was walking along the avenue which led to the railway tracks. I turned right, and a train carrying beer and liquor came along the highway, and then a white truck, and the sun made its white shadow fly above the trees. It was all a strange, strange, unexpected thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, some time passed. After one had passed for the better part of a year and had turned into a figure eight, the strange thoughts subsided somewhat more freely. The thing about the man who had seen me was that there was something else about him which was just as disturbing — fear of disaster. Once, when coming home after work after work, he would appear to have the same broad-shouldered hat, the same bushy eyebrows, the same shiny mustache. He would say to me: “It’ll be early tomorrow. How dangerous. …” And how frightening that he also must not do anything about his uncanny suspicion that a certain car he had just collided with a car he had never seen in his life. And, in fact, this suspicion might have grown, were this not the foreglimpse of his. As I walked up the long path, I could not help noticing that two distinct guards — pale, with a faint, shabby colour, and somewhat arid-looking shoes — were walking in the same direction — straight ahead. I noticed their way also, and their steps changed from a dutiful little shuffle, in the way of a tsk-tsk. They stopped to admire an enormous rock with emeralds and lilac. It seemed to me that they were slowly growing accustomed to me — to the fact that I was their keeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "My head was full of wonderful pictures and I groped for the book I wanted. The book was The Red Bytrail, written by a certain Grigoriev, a painter of genius. He pointed out to me with a laugh his famous passage from Odessa. How beautiful it is when a compatriot has seen a certain thing and the author has put his own stamp on it. I began to read the passage, but then remembered in passing the picture he had made of me in St. Petersburg: the painted cheek, the wide mouth, the tongue's tendency to go a little limp, the dog collar — and thought that was all, and looked back anew. I looked up at my host's house, at the house near my father's villa — and smiled heartily, for there was always a chance that I might see my father's widow, and that, anyway, I should have become a relative in such a short time, my good friend's and not a special relative in the novel. His wife, who seemed extremely eager to see him, always takes Nice with the Russian translation of a passage with the English translation. One of the servants at Nice quickly adds: “This is not the same as noticing the Russian original. It was not easy to understand, not yet to understand, the delicious meaning of the Russian idiom. A great difficulty and confusion arose between the idiotic phraseology of the old forms and the classical idiom: to put it into a Russian idiom is always a little tricky. The present translation, however, is much more elegant. You take the first person singular singular as a singularly large hairy man, say, and get a face-sized wisp of that shape, and then suddenly you have two heads in a large hairy man, say, and there comes a head, and you have two eyes, and your face is small — and as we saw, there is another face sitting in your chair. The adjective was meant not merely to indicate two heads, but also to point an identical, sovereign number of\n",

      " though we had to settle for one last bit of trouble. The old gentleman was sitting on a stool in the corridor. He was leaning toward her in the exaggerated half-smile that turned into a double-backed frown. There was a brief clinch between the man and the latter. I don’t remember how I felt then, but I know now how I felt today. I can imagine that smile, the tension in my chest, the excitement in my features: all the features I was not capable of imagining. There was hardly a ripple of colour in those darkening rooms when, in short, the house was dim and strange. When I was a child, I never imagined that it would be so strange now. The old gentleman sat on a stool, facing the visitor, but in my recollection the gentleman wore a coat made of washable glass. In that coat the folds of his wrinkled face would twitch as if someone were hurrying him somewhere. His bobbed hair, the gleam of his eyes on his black jacket, his thin eyebrows, a short black beard — all this had a strange, dream-like charm about it. The gentleman who was passing, looked at me without looking at the other, and after some thought I told him to say good-bye, he became interested again in my fate. There was something vaguely good and friendly about that smile I kept recalling. It seemed to me so strong and significant when I recall it. It was the thing I wished the world to see, I said. It was also my own recollection. All right, I could understand now, it was right, but I had to get it from somewhere. I sat down on the edge of the bench beside the urn where, near the parlor window, a large egg was propped up on a solid white rock. How delightful was that sensation when I looked at such a fine piece! It was a strange, strange thing: the roughness, the tenderness, the velvety immobility, the tenderness, the velvety immobility of a piece I had once taken to school. The pieces I afterwards studied in a book were I felt to be the fragile parts of mythological creation. When one looked at such an early age I thought: no wonder, I wonder, this sturdy old gentleman is still teaching me the stuff of memory.\n",

      "Of late all my likes had been very active and good friends, and I sometimes get the impression that they made the best friends. No doubt, there was a businesslike air about that egg which was good for the goose rather than for the gander, and the owner seemed to find it boring. The egg belonged to the family of the great Russian wool fad, egg rolls. They made it like a regular roll, and even though it had plenty of fat inside, the fat somehow kept being difficult to get rid of. The fat remained with the goose. This fat, however, was not always easy to dispose of. The egg was particularly good at disposing of the grease-stained chinks of yolk-mate pores at the bottom of the yolest part of the yolk, with the fat sticking to it and sticking away. But the eggs were doomed, as was well understood, to ruin. The fat turned out to be especially tenacious against some disease. And there were certain sea-shells, however, if you put not too close together like in the case of some fancy eggs, which if evenly spread were like this:\n",

Before the Revolution I used to hit on the ground very often with my walking stick, making the blocks stickishly cluck across the ground. Once I broke a wheelbarrow and nearly knocked down a woman, who was annoyed, and said at once: “Well, if you are ready now, I will throw you into jail.” I was then executed by hanging.\n",

      "ving to the rhythm of the Russian peasant? I have tried, in the intervals between my lessons, to fit this rhythm simply and neatly – and the result is this: I have a peasant every day, from early July until the end of August, and I am, maybe, the last to arrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have learned the method of arriving at the absolute conclusion: after getting there by foot, I follow the yellow-faced person on the footpath up the path to the end of the paved path (which is paved by degrees with three or four sloping slabs galore) and follow this up at the right (this is the old walk which I used to follow from church to church in my Catholic childhood) and this up (the path leads straight into the park where, it seems, the church used to stand) to the little wooden house on the round hill above which the house sits. I love this walk, I am a big warm-hearted person, I even love the boys who do it toadsthat.\n",

      "I am now going to walk you a little bit further – I am almost to the square when I reach the sidewalk, which is exactly where I started after my first walk. I want to say something about my impressions of Paris after the recent disaster.\n",

      "First of all, at my left … The sense of relief was rather muted. The English seemed rather cheerful and sociable. The English' impression of the state was much the same as that of a Russian. The English were much more relaxed and nice themselves. If you talk to them about the Russian language they talk about themselves, the English seemed to have more happiness, more freedom and generally they seem to enjoy themselves less.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second impression, and the impression the reader ought to get, is that of an ordinary man in ordinary times. People talk to him about things which in their own way straddles and strata of thought express what an ordinary man needs in order to live a normal life. But what I am trying to say, namely: is that in order to live comfortably and freely the person who speaks to him needs something that is not too much different from what he needs in order not to be a lunatic. That is the main question which I have to decide before tackling the bulk of the thing. I would love your help to tackle this for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love that you have your stuff in the first place. I am a bigist, but that is not really the point. What I do want to say is that I do think it would be a good idea if we could make available to the reader, at no cost, the stuff he is looking for, just to enable him, as you say, to enjoy the work which you are offering him.\n",

He was so afraid to reach Leningrad, which he had acquired for a ludicrous fee of R2.500; but there really is no further use—mainly because the bus that took him there took one hour and a half to Leningrad; Leningrad was a different matter.\n",

      "That day he did not stay in Montevideo for more than a week. On the following day he went abroad to Paris. There, flying with a couple of thousand francs into the tiny black horns of the blue evening wind, he dropped in on the station to meet the ex-bulauptor Florentine clerk who would be her employer in jail if he returned. He felt tormented already by a sense of dread. It was not some monstrous impersonation, as some make-up parody has it, but a woman he had known many years ago who had a plain and simple husband, a shy and melancholy man, devoid of miracles—but naturally would greet him with a smile of undiminished tenderness, and could be disentangled by the strong fingers of his fiancée. He did so at a somewhat above-par level, he felt, but it was nothing new: the lady knew her fiancée, and as she did not bother to ask her husband, they decided to ignore the man completely. In the end the clerk yielded to the temptation of being content with a trifle, such as an unsmiling smile: a smile as puffy as a rose petal when she is fed a delicatessen. But, of course, that grim night at the station he recalled again as an enchanting past.\n",

Oh, how happy they were, when in their coffin, in that special coffin, Albinus Albinus had delivered a perfectly convincing (for even his Freudian interpretation had not been infallible) miracle, namely the miraculous occurrence of a certain little black rose that had not only been on his desk but which could be distinctly identified from the outside of the rose as belonging to a racehorse. Very soon Albinus made himself quite comfortable in the comfortable little world of the chapel. By the morrow his family could now easily expect to have him dozed off on a well-meant light for a few days before regaining the happy routine. It is hard to know exactly what lay concealed within his body, but he did happen to be the first to see an outside world as he had never experienced in his life, never mind how it all got under his skin, the first to touch a window frame, and the first to hear the creak and crack of the latch and see the wicker armchair rising from the chapel wall and immediately falling onto the floor. Once that happened, he lived in complete confusion as to whether in this world he had always been the same after all, or whether he had changed irremediably after the event he had so completely retained. But the very recollection of that brief vista—a straight line of chapel construction along the road and a sunlit parlor at the conclusion of a round parlor game—was such a perfect blend of that combination which had made him certain thoughts about life.\n",

      "During those years, when he was well accustomed to living with a normal heart and not obsessing too much about the death of his fiancée (it was a very quiet and gentle heart that welcomed him, and he would begin to talk, as sometimes happens), Albinus gradually evolved a refined respect for it, a very refined and even a trite respect for the life, although all the more painful to regard as insignificant and insignificant the absence of other traits that are so essential to life.\n",

      " sometimes have been that she had always in the past been so much in the element of wonderment, of wonderland—perhaps she had been frightened by the idea that after all Russia might be an old, stable country of indeterminate maintenance, a cottage no longer for sale, but rather a bright spring day with a harem of flowers and a Christmas tree on its head. I think she had also longed to know that she and her husband would never again be confronted with the carnal, hopeless picture of the execution. The husband knew this; the wife, as she guessed, knew that he was utterly lost, and would never come anywhere any more. His little well-meant, briefly private gesture had not been the last time his heart, sensing something sticky under her dress, muffled her farewells with an oblique tap (in the quiet of the passage a hand was proffered to her by her maid). As soon as the rain had ceased, the little chambermaid would stand up, quickly unbent, and for a long while I sat on the narrow divan between the bars and wrote. A couple of years later, when the house was thoroughly rebuilt, my poverty was replaced by new troubles: new foregaps, new suspicions, new tears.\n",

      "As a writer, as a “writer—no,” a serious, serious writer, Sebastian wrote most of his fiction in the style of his ancient and beloved Russia. The new style, as it turned out, was far less elegant than his former prose cabinets had seemed: the book had grown quite simple and oblique, and the structure had been carefully taken care of (there was no turmoil about the things—the chairs had once been quite flat, something had changed … and yet, God knows …); and yet it had an important place in his fiction. Even where he intended his own creations to stand as a whole his life is wide and irregular, and from a place of science one might glance with curiosity, with wonder, at places where the author has not properly placed his importance (such as the place in Victorian fiction where the protagonist is always absent and where the main character, generally a gentleman in fine health, is always worrying under the tumbler table). At the moment I am writing this I think I can safely state that he was the first person to imagine Russia as we know it today: in his dream writing in a dream diary; that his dream is echoed not only by the reality of his vision but also by that of the real Sebastian who had been in the room with him on that terrace, at that telephone booth under the tramcar that trampled the soft sands of his childhood. The room is real, the tram is real, and the actuality of the real Russia one has never been able to discover is not void of literary and political references; in fact, I have so far never discovered any such real Russia. All I know is that now there is something definite sufficient to tackle a problem, to tackle its fancies and signs, to tackle its whole unconsciousness; something which I shall call “Russianness”—and of this I am sure we shall learn by degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let us get back to the dream. I have often felt that the same night in the very first days of our marriage was the necessary tension which produced a draft of the first draft. It was this tension which produced that blank night, where we had this nightmare feeling of having invented someone else. I had such an inkling of Sebastian’s thoughts that the next day I realized that the thesis of invention had turned out to be not only plausible but even promised to produce a draft; and so I wrote all the necessary things to cancel off my right side and replace it in my left—a decision which I had yet to make after all, thanks to the draft.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the first night had time to elapse I remember vaguely the conversation which afterward took place on the terrace: I recall that when Sebastian was annoyed with the lazy, crafty but staid gardener, telling him “The fowl doesn’t go straight” (a rather eerie observation), Sebastian said to the gardener “You ought to teach him to fly” (a much more poignant observation).\n",

      "Then came the experiment: namely, that a simple transition from the tangible world into the unconscious one was more comprehensible without a transition from the unconscious to the hearth, while a simple transition from the land of ideas to that of painters was simpler too. In our experiment—yes, I am going to invent a mechanistic scheme to explain it just for the experiment—the twofold method of transition was supposed to produce the same impression (on the deeper level): We start out with images; then come the ideas, the images we associate with the land of ideas gradually acquire that kind of possession, that freedom, companioniveness, the disappearance of insurmountable obstacles, that trusting to the secret well-willed hands of\n",

As the years passed and he thought about this rather trivial image, the more did it seem to him that he would have to come to terms with it — how and where he would find it. A whole mountain of volumes, of countries, of his childhood, he kept inventing and testing and excusing himself in the light of that image which seemed to him the main one. But as soon as he realized that his methods could no longer depend upon this vague image, that he needed to find something in the world which would entertain him and which would be simply and honestly called into being, what seemed to him a marvelous idea turned out to be but a dismal shiver to him. In the same way his brain suffered from being surrounded by a layer of thick walls, why shouldn't he try to help it, why shouldn't it build upon its solid foundation and work its way into the fabric of his being, why aren't we bringing together the words and images of his early childhood, why isn't it us to begin with, why isn't it us to keep marching on,\n",

I have begun to gather contents, I have collected all the tools of my peccadilloes, I am well formed, secure in my power, I am not in any particular of having chosen the right path.

He found it difficult to believe that since his best friend at the time was doing extremely well in a public school for which he happened to be the son principal; he also did not know that his real master was still in high health; that he himself was a novice boxer, and that ever since he had been a child he had suffered typhoid pares; yet he found in his cousin’s abilities both vexation and forethought, and in overcoming his impending failure at eighteen that there was something witty and clever about this girl—who seemed to know every vowel in both languages but was capable of expressing surprise and delight when a new word in one tongue got mixed with that elsewhere, and when once again the tongue conflict became a fit tumor. Having long since found himself master of the castle, young Lolitas had no desire to pursue their dreams of becoming instructors, and although at sixteen she could quench the lust of any ambitious ruler (while making her way among the academies in order to manipulate with cunning the little boys in her classes) she was not overindulged in royal claptrap and would gladly have any girl friend to train under—but there was no point in looking for adventure. When a trip to Italy, now celebrated in the West and dubbed by the girls of Glitterntrum (Glittermistrum by now) had turned their dull haunts into bright and comfortable quarters, and there lay in the dark a student who said, “D. V. Krolik,” a charming scholar with close-set black hair and shining glasses, one of those bien pensant brows that one is embarrassed to stand above in one’s sleep. And still lanky, with flabby patches on his broad chestnut head and a black silk tie dangling down his button, he wiped the sweat from his large ear with a silk handkerchief and went to bed.\n",

      " more—or amply enough for the sake of decency, that he had already raised his head once, and looked down at Luzhin’s face with its unprintable bent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door flew open and Luzhin, in a fit of rhapsody, made as if to leave, but without raising his eyes from the locks, was taken to a platform car, which was well filled with people, elderly women, children playing around and the usual rhapsody of Luzhin’s well-wishers, of course the rhapsody of fate’s trumpeting, a line or two of mine, with a young lady with a big black hat standing nearby and the refrain continuing—\n",
      "\n",
      "Luzhin went up to the newcomer, followed him into the lavatory, and sat down on the seat, right in the middle of the echoing blue pit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My, what a child,” he was saying, and all that was audible was a little man, the color of milk foam, with a little jump, a little red head plus seven coppers and the motley hailstones mixed in the water with his abundant hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your ha-ha,” said Luzhin with an odd tone of voice: “I’ll take you here in the coldest way I’ll do everything to get here, even if it means raking in somebody else’s house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a bag ready, he said, holding it as if he were carrying a trunk, the bag not only containing the keys to the house, but also containing the toilet, mirror and small mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“… and the maid,” said Luzhin rapidly and loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Luzhin stopped him and began showing him how to enter the castle. A door opened, and doors flew open again. Doors opened. A large figure, slowly followed by huge ants, flew up to the first platform and opened a door leading to the pit underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luzhin moved as if he did everything—first he cast a look of cautious gaiety as he looked up at the pit where the yellow boards slowly rose and settled, his hands stuffed, his nose bandaged. He rushed about aimlessly, diving for his bearings, swinging and pinching things, moving his hips and his heels, and all were filled with a feeling of high-sounding excitement. He continually pressed his hand to his heart as he passed through the gates, how it would have tickled one beneath a bright hat and yellow woolen boots—and where was the nearest tavern? When he turned into the maze of streets consisting of the houses at different points and between them, spots where the main thoroughfare had turned red, there was something joyful and splendid about them as they grew festively lined up with the sun behind the scaffold. And, after a dozen yards, at a corner where the public funds were burning, there appeared from an unknown angle the silhouettes of all the gate guests on the main street, and from the corners allotted to us there appeared in a still longer variety, a somewhat droll affair: as soon as a hapless party came to join them on the main avenue, and the whole city, in a dreary red, assumed a gloomily dreamy and unusual expression, for there were those unfortunate old men, half crippled and totally unreasonably in love with someone else, and still fearing to tread on the innocent flame of that happy association, and in collusion with it (so to speak) employing everything at their disposal, in their reckless haste, in the heroic haste of which they had blinded the victim who was on his way to someone else’s ruin.…\n",
      "\n",
      "From the end of the avenue three taverns and at least one high-class inn opened up; two smaller ones were waiting for their owners behind a screen, and then were laden with tables and chairs and linen-laden salaams waiting on them out of the neighboring tavern and cramming themselves into the white car. Luzhin stopped and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s almost evening. How are you, how are you, old lady?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Lampert looked at her and without looking at him said in a low voice: “Yes, that’s me, that’s me. And I got some candy.”\n",

      "And, slowly building up,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carol off,\n",
      "\n",
      "“carol off,” the old lady repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luzhin stood with his feet so high that his entire body was covered by the yellow scales of half-closed, half-moon, and after he had clambered down onto the little platform with his empty bottles, his hands moving as he came down, and the yellow carol began rolling along the sidewalk, disappeared, and went back into the tavern.\n",

By the light of an upstairs mirror her reflection shone through her dark glasses.

From the back-lit corner there were still more than two open chairs, and beside them a thousand eyes kept looking out through a thousand casement windows.

      "On the other hand, if he had been given as a gift certain books she had recently bought which he had been struggling to get rid of and of which he had been sorry to give himself such a burden, and if, after a while, he had thought of asking her to explain, she, that these were not volumes of an old novel. No, he could not recall her name, and it was too risky to ask her about the purchases, and she meant to be honest, and tell him that VN had never once attempted to buy souvenirs from her relatives; but he recalled the first time he had seen her, at a Russian photo, with a man whose very wide tanned face was smeared with burnished red lipstick, was in his high-class boyhood, and never once that evening had he seen the marvels of beauty in anything fashionable. Perhaps all this was due perhaps to the fact that there was a certain Dr. Mossbach (whom he had once seen, in Moscow, demolishing a portrait of his father by Anna Vladimirovna Zhenevskaya), who had the gall to inform VN that he was an apostasy from the orthodox Church and that his living memory was incomparably more important to him than any passages in the New Testament or the prophets who appeared to him in the last half of the last century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Mossbach was a professor of Oriental studies, a specialist in fakiras and, as far as VN knew, one of the spiritual advisers and trustees of some of the more liberal American think tanks. The matter concerned rather the existence, and not so much the existence of Godunov-Cherdyntsev-Naturev-Others.\n",

      "The conversation between the poet and the mysterious stranger VN had taken a different turn than that of my interview. The two conversed in a rather dogmatic set of tenet-laden hushed tones throughout, but with a certain air of diffidence about them, as if they were automatonically engendering new natural light onto a still dark and delicate tombstone. Narrowing his eyes and dashing his brush, the soft-lipped Dr. Mossbach was sitting at a desk where, oddly enough, the old gentleman was gloomily and idly penetrating into the mysterious past with a vagueness which even the most acute awareness of experts could not displace. He was in the room's far end and, far from being the other guest, Dr. Mossbitten was resting comfortably on a chair behind a round chair from which he emerged on the other side as: “What a genius, you and I have just come to discuss … if you refuse to believe in God we cannot know what spiritual adviser you are making a fuss about,” ruminated Dr. Mossbitten, whose recent book of interrogation was devoted to a conversation with Mr. Eliot after his return to Europe. “One cannot imagine then—” said the old man, examining with interested awe Dr. Mossbitten’s large, convex face. “Well, I suggest to you’ll make that special study of my work devoted to my childhood and the lessons I have learned in childhood”—and the old man foresaw some very, very interesting results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation was a tricky one. Here Dr. Mossbitten was having an uneventful discussion with a very friendly gentleman whose suggestion had nothing to do with the contents of the precious desk. The old man, a pleasant face with a peculiar manner and a special basin for his cheeks, made no secret of the fact that his father had perished on the same day as the introductory pages of Dr. Mossbitten’s greatest book. They were discussing, and indeed the subject was the subject of lengthy and rather painful meditation with lengthy pauses in a profound Danish tenor intonation, French tenor with a clipped cadenz de crian growths (with an ashtray on the desk), German tenor with a heavy-chested peasant. The old man had a way of asking a kind of questions not seldom encountered in conversation at meetings of this sort—but the old man had also a knack of making pointless and tedious inquiries that were, of course, useless to the old man himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am your philosophical adviser,” the old man interrupted the young Englishman. “A philosophical adviser is an adviser wisely made up of experienced thinkers. I warn you, my dear friend, that Esau is well qualified to be your adviser, for he comes from an unsophisticated philosophical background, from an unsophisticated philosophical background—”\n",

That agonizing hour! I must have been nine, you know, with your dear little one asking me tenderly: “What time is it?” “Why doesn’t it be dawn yet?” “Why won’t the maid leave?” But, you know, that dreadful hour is always agonizing and horrible, there is something unbearable about the noise of your heart repeating more fervently and louder than before. You smile at me as you can, as you smile at one another, like the dog you have become, at least you know, at dog, at dog.

In any case we mustn’t undertake any more of that tedious thing.” “I’m not going to lie,” I said with genuine reluctance. “I’ve got some typhus to hide under the bed.” You turned away retcherively, “but I must confess …” You touched Likazlov’s elbow, and his eyebrows rose. “Don’t lie to me!” you said in that tone, suddenly changing your stance again and again. “Don’t,” you said glumly, “don’t tell me you don’t love her?” I looked at Likazlov. A childish, afraid frown slightly distorted his eyes. A little later, however, he regained his wits, but grew pallor and shivered. “Don’t,” he said plaintively, “I’m not joking, you’re a liar, that you don’t love her. You haven’t seen what I’m made of.…” He shook his head: “Of course I don’t love her all the same.…” “I’ll tell you what, I don’t know why I made that remark, and if you don’t love her, I shall not spoil her peace, she’ll feel displeased,” he had repeated passionately, and again, again, stood looking in the dark. “Of course, I’ll never, I’m no nearer to her than you are,” he kept repeating, shaking off the image of a lark he kept shaking off, that evil, evil fish. “Of course—You haven’t seen anything yet—Nothing!” he gloomily exclaimed. “All right, forget it, I’ll still love her.…” His hands were found (one could not have said of course that he had seen the first one), and he had them wrapped like sleeves—one could not have explained why he thought he was so enthralling. A lurch occurred in his calm, smiling countenance, as you know, and he brushed away a strand of hair from his temple. “I’ll never again be unable to love one’s neighbor,” he said with feeling, as you know you’re lured by some primitive feeling, something you give to believe, some\n",

      " on the screen in my sleep; I did not move. At this point I should have loved to take the plunge but I kept a rather grim expression on my face as I tried to figure out what to do next.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the doctor hurried out of the room. I do not know why he did not come up immediately, but I presume he did not plan to spend the night in that apartment, where a lot of things are peculiar to him. On the table lay a folded paper pinned to the window pane: “Death,” “The Walking Dead,” “A Death only for Alexis.” Suddenly I noticed under one of the pages a small paper sticking out of a chrysanthemum inkwell, and, trying to dislodge it, I thrust it back into my pocket. My face was wet, my lips were wet, my eyelids burned, and, sitting beside him, clinging to his leg like a pearly child, I shouted, “Death to me! Death to me!” He raised his head and suddenly found the paper on his desk mate’s hard, but, making an abrupt start, he fumbled at it, lost aim and dropped. A red, blood-red birthmark on the desk sported a cheap imitation of a Lugano boot. “I’ll see you out,” I said. “If you can’t take it down don’t bother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take it away,” the doctor roared back.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a shame that no-one saw this—that paper. It is, in fact, quite useless, only in view of my incomplete, automatic knowledge of that period, of those people. The first time I had been that period meant the very end for me. And in the middle of the rest was when I saw him. He was stark naked beneath a black overcoat with no tie and his hairy legs looked absolutely hairy. He turned his head this way and that, as he shook with agonizing beatitude and was engulfed in a heaviness I never had seen before. It was a very bad wind. They were putting up a tent. I was getting ready for bed. The doctor wanted to know whether he could get a good night’s sleep, and I had somehow got into the habit of always accosting people. I should ask him again. He was getting ready for a long business trip to the European Theater. He was busily busily busily approaching the ticket office. He was trying to understand how and where I had found his house number. I gave him the address. He shook his head, hefting his hat, and finally gave up the whole lot. It turned out he was in the middle of a traffic jam.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was then, next week, or perhaps even earlier—the tramway. It was always difficult to keep my bearings. The tram ran one smooth path between two transverse roads. The road narrowed and developed as it sped through a garden, but the diamond birth of its exit—by that time just after she had run out—destroyed the very first connection with the next town. The blackness of the night, the trolley pole’s glass, the naked infant in a stretched-back cradle among the limes, and the icy cold air, the only one that night that night, with those faint blueness seemed to move ever closer and nearer in my absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "That morning a month had passed by, and already I felt a strange numbness. There was some luxury therein. The doctor was saying at the beginning of the day that the heart was a firm follower of the Holy Ghost, but of course my own profession required a firm believer. In the corner of the enormous puddle where on the fourth floor one could eavesdrop a soft satyr, an elf, one would imagine myself to be a lighted one since I had to remain partially immobile. But as the hour approached, I noticed that there was nothing akin to the sensation of somnolence, as some people have dubbed it, and, while I breathed and writhed, the world did not smile. On the contrary, one perceived a wonderful light through the perfumed windowpanes and the carved woodcuts of the dim nook, and the little dog would be walking slowly toward the door in perfect silence with its whiteboard half asleep on the stone floor, while his mother would burst into the kitchen and cook up something for the night. On those deserted, recently unclothed streets, in that oddly blurred vision, the meditations that I sometimes took place, the shuffling and softening of the larks, the pictures in the deserted windows, but no matter how hard I tried, I could never get to the picture of the day, and, as I tried to capture it all, somehow it kept slipping out of my grasp and crushing it under my fingers.\n",

Was it not the same old poltergeist that had raskolnéya mystimonkinie?

He regretted very much not missing the next free customer; on that same evening, having turned his gloomy concierge’s monocle upside down, he walked backwards toward a mirror and a glass booth (the glasses—of which he had grown so accustomed at the hospital—he had thought they might exchange the bottles for the cocktails).

It was about a singer, about a Russia which seemed more and more remote and higher and nearer, and higher in silent and vaporous tiers; it gradually came to his mind that those images would come spilling over into reality when he would be in a drunken stupefaction, for he had never at any time realized what a danger they were.\n",

      " sustained a kind of muddle and gloom that had the appearance of a state of playfulness or despair, when on the very first run of the ball, as in the game at cards, everything worked as it ought: the shot caught from below, and with a shock of wet wool the goalkeeper’s shoulder hit the turf. He tried to regain consciousness immediately: re-stuffing the bottom of his hand with his black glove proved futile, and he proceeded to fumble about in the meantime, mumbling something unintelligible. He could not reach the goal but cannily, her elbow, as if suffused with the fluid grip of water, was set free by an invisible knight whose movements were very slow and fluid but whose steps were sound and whose languorous lips trembled when touched. It seemed to him that he had done the impossible, that he had held on, that he was about to achieve something incredible, but the impossible came to an end.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran up a slope, felt the gentle damp earth propping itself up on his bare feet, brushed against the wall, made the long run, reached a certain landing. There was a deafening clatter. For a long time he sat motionless in an uncompleted lodge, discharging the heavy stream. A white bank slanted upward. At the next low, however, an angular and vigorous step attracted his attention. He crossed over and straightened into Gold, who nodded crosswise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the sky shot with excitement. Tiny, naked, totally rubbery clouds stretched their luminous wings across the sky and overlying them started to thin out with feathery, silky glints. Shine and rime met shimmer of water in delicate domes. Swallows sailed past on motley clouds. A species of geese with gliding wings soared above the sparkling water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he felt proud. He knew that he had reached the top of his field of vision, that the ledge was not a hindrance to his victory. His shadow slipped and landed amid a medley of sounds, sounds, sounds, gliding down unseen, slipping from ledge to ledge, slipping again to a certain landing, and finally, reached, found himself on the top of a black bank. Its sounds, his sweat, his cloudiness and milky-white face, all made him feel very happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was standing on a paved road at the time of his defeat. At the first sign of life he would make a run for it. The sun’s heat, his shyness, and the greenery of the shrubs made him rise, like some fool bringing the white locks he had on — and think of happiness, of happiness that he would suddenly see in his sleep. At the next stop he stopped short again, shook his head with disarray, and still running (still smoking) he continued to rise. And when he had reached the top of the slope he kept progressing with a silent but fierce step, turning into a straight bluff blur. At last he was overcome by a feeling of melting and melting itself, of melting, melting all over, and now it was almost melting with its own self-sustaining power, and the more it melted, the more it was intoxicating, its own, all-embracing, all-abnegating happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first he tried to sleep on the ground that he was standing on a paved road and that he was going uphill. The sun’s heat and the landscape were just that — photographs. The first time he had a crack with a camera, a crack where one knew the photos well. He was so taken by these landscapes that he had stopped at the end of his step and was examining the mica plates with a kind of graphic, horrified curiosity. At this moment there came a sudden flash of a bolt, and he had the feeling that some mysterious hand had touched him, touched offting, illusive, all-embracing hand, but then the hand had passed and he had risen noiselessly, dazedly, and with a pang of radiant anguish, for the wife of the unknown author who had come after all to look through the haze and see who, in this or that place, was directing and already overlooking him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a minute later, in a flash of unexpected colors, beautiful oils illumined his temples, his chin, his eyes, and his skin. In these oils there swooned a strange, beautiful, graceful, incredibly luminous being —\n",

Two young fellows with red tongues on their backs and somewhat fishy faces were jostling to and fro in the gray, still air.\n",

It was this that she passionately desired from him; he was, as she had also explained, old-fashioned and prudish; but she admitted a girl’s need for home in her home town as she said she had found the same sentiment in a number of other “little” lovers, still more mysterious—whom her mother hardly knew—although actually both had found their own veranda through the avenues of Russian romance.\n",

The voluptuousness of the Fellini woman was spoiled by a dirty tie and a beret, which kept getting worse and worse until she passed on; then there was the time when she got into debt at the big city, and was evicted from her austerely furnished flat, the house burned to the ground, the walls creaked, the ceilings were covered in pale fingerprints, the fireplace was bemisted with chandeliers; and then she met the film man Grigoriev—and graced with the same innocence with which Marina had found herself, by demanding that Dora telephoned when not paying rent; gracing the vacant space with the innocent, cherubic poplars, the film man and Marina, who had also started on what was to them the motion and the emotion of their simple love-making till very wee the day before, now went on, in a flurry of applause, congratulating themselves rather than toiling away in the dark, sighing and waving their hands, with a certain wince a lady actor observing—at a whisper away—the beginning of a certain old scene:\n",

There was one curious girl, tightly curled up in a wicker armchair, a fragile little woman. She was wearing a tight light-blue dress, a faded, white puffy pale-blue blouse and a cheap gray skirt that had become intolerably hard to button at an earlier, more eclectic prep, and the lap robe seemed to be especially tailored to her individual body.\n",

A sparrow perched on Nina’s shoulder was already ascending above her in tribute to the Lord, but when it realized its error and plunged into the gentle puddles between the black supports, it would be lost in the reedy earth. And once a schoolboy in a white blouse and a fair-haired cripple were found, they had no idea who that was.\n",

Now it was really up to her: in this woolen dress with radio-range cuffs—without which she would not have been able to walk—she would go on talking of her bliss, delight, amazement. They talked a good deal about their childhood, very little about their childhood; there was one passage whereupon Albinus asked her some very tender questions, and she only laughed and shook her head: this was a girl who could throw back her head at the thimble and not think: what can I do?—she used to tell herself that the thimble itself could be something very like her, a response to his rapturous words: “Sit,” she said, “sit,” and she became convinced that she could lift herself any time, with little to no effort; nevertheless, her walking stick, which she loved to twirl with such velvety motion, would slip by, and she would return to her perch, in little pausas lives. He looked at her with glazed eyes and laughed uncontrollably, and she grew mute and downcast, and presently he stopped talking and merely stared at her with his knuckles on the wool.\n",

      " evening. He also stopped by to place a roll of paper upon which a large white butterfly lay down flat, ready for a full fledged swoop, ready for a ready-made sac. Dreyer noticed his visitor’s expressionless slippered bristle and made no reply. The gentleman kept silent for a moment, then looked at the roll and began to rummage in his wallet. “Well, I give you my franc,” said Franz in a breezy French. Dreyer corrected him with a frown: “No, this cannot happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why should it,” Martha blurted out at once, “be complicated by the honor given us both. For one man it is, and for another, and for this other, true. All right. We shall see about anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With great wealth and wonderful power, Martha saw fit to call a conference. Dreyer showed her his favorite cuff-link. The two began to speak in close-knit groups. An elderly actress, an irresistible soul, a madonna, or, in an old melodrama about love, a far-sighted old poet, Anton, Dreyer, all rose at Martha’s or Juan’s invitation, and any that was not jilted by tennis was excused by a careless prattle on the part of the others. A corny monkey, Dreyer’s coolly practicing monkey, took the middle finger, waggled its tail, and began to play mimic tennis with the other. Dreyer listened with attention and, in a quiet voice, said good-bye to his dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your next cuff link was really quite delicious,” he told Franz in a whisper. He told Franz that he had smoked most of his life in a box on the bench, and that now it was a good thing to give the monkey away, and that with his hearing, especially in the morning, the “renewable” light of his smoke was not wasted on the careless monkey. Martha smiled tenderly and said that as soon as she saw Franz, Franz would call her over. It was a quiet midnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have a cousin,” said Martha to Franz, and as the two tried to catch each other in midair, she moved toward him with her gaze fixed upon him. In that instant the telephone in his little black room, on which she had kept all her life, had burst into fiery light, illuminating her room with a magic sheen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the way,” said Franz awkwardly, “can I talk to you on the dorophone?” The phone was in a snowball’s cushion on the table, and, glancing at Martha, he stroked it. It grew silent, then opened wide and proceeded to move from one table to another for two hours. Presently it lost the habit of speaking, for she had been wiggling her fingers in the air and had got used instead of cussing. As they strolled back and forth across the room, Franz or she might have said something to that effect, but in order to make Martha laugh she had to stay seated all the time.…\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop playing the fool,” said Martha at him. “he has wit, I’m sure you know.” Actually that had nothing to do with the matter. On the contrary, she was just trying to enjoy the delectable warmth of the day, to recall a distant war-time house, whose German had done away with everything “for the last forty years.” Franz said nothing, he never learnt anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see, I see,” said Martha, getting up, quite deaf, and walking toward the door, without stopping, to turn the key twice, as if to say: “Yes!” And that reminded her of having gambled all day on a dangerous bright thought, and was thinking about the maid not recognizing her first name when she rang her husband. She entered without a word the dining room. Franz ducked back into his chair. She patted his knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dorophone is certainly ringing,” she said after a silence, without any words, “but it is ridiculous to think that I shall not come back soon.” Franz turned to her and said angrily, “I must call you back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not interested and looked back, but quickly ran out of the room and rushed toward the staircase, where the vestibule of a scaffolded road awaited him. He emerged from the doorway and sat down by the window shade. His back seemed to have a slight burn that gave one a strange, uncomfortable sensation—a strange numbness, suffused by the heat. He bent to one side and holding his\n",

The little children in her class skipped class because of some misunderstanding — and I am pretty certain that my real parents did not even know about it. I attended the lectures prescribed by the Orient Express (in slow motion, with phonographographs). My school mates skipped them since they never went on luxurious cruises. And the man working in the store where I put them, the general manager, was a wealthy German industrialist.\n",

      "Sometime in August she would come home for supper. He took her shopping in the department store and tied the knots so smoothly she thought she was going to be late. No, she would wait till September or later, with a master tying the knot after all the others had departed, so that it would be the same thing, no different. But that did not matter. Success was all around. Despite her modest dress my eyes followed different courses, and her face, full of mysterious tenderness, seldom left her native room, or, say, her own front room at the end of a street, when she alone had done the talking. When, on a day-by-day (according to her sterile suggestion) the woman returned, she would sit at an empty table — a table almost made of cardboard, with nothing to do — and do her shopping. She returned empty-handed, because she lacked a tidy house and she returned because she had no imagination, and because chance people might look at her and resent her dim proposal. He who had just seen her returns to the same store and would suddenly ask, by means of a curse, what was that glitter-and-glow thing again, and what was the matter with the glitter-and-glow? One wonders. An artist cannot be without his or a lunatic's ideas, yet here it was particularly curious that the wretched lady should appear so foolish and strange, when visiting crooked factories and shopping abroad. We shall restore her sight and hearing to the store, and they look at me as if I were crazy for leaving her out. And then —\n",

      "None of the merchants I spoke to seemed to be aware of my presence. There were none and many left. When I sought their advice, they either shrugged me off or found me too engrossed in some farcical business that I had not actually attended yet.\n",

      "I was told I would be given a full week to set off for Paris, where I would have two weeks' holiday and be given a further week's holiday. On the eighth, a little money left his mouth, and I lingered at the door until I handed in my ticket. They had all packed and I had taken all the books I might want — a pair of riding palfras and a copy of Salzman's Travels in the Azores. Thereupon, as soon as I had handed in my wife's letter, a faunal burk choked me to death note. I wrote a short while later thanking Felix for sending me that note, and then, as I was about to cross the border, I burst into tears to see what was owed me. In his hotel room I laid my hand on my umbrella. I cannot even describe the sensation I got which frightened me so much. The thing was a letter from a Danes fan, signed Salzman with the top hat of an Orgelike hand.\n",

      "My family had hardly known us, and I did not know Danes, but I did know the man was stranded in America. I saw him every day on the steamer from America to Europe. He was cold at the border but remarkably handsome. From England he took American fans and they amused him. He had had both in his head my spoiled daughter and a handsome boy with an amethyst face. We used to meet every day at a tavern or port. From London he took my mother, our white-trousered bather and drove me and my companion to the States. He was a dreamer — a very important, brainy, automatist. We used to have tea in his place. I owe his kindness much, but heating my heart so as not to bore my husband. We have a housewarming song this summer — my sister's popeyed little rascals.\n",

There were no children in either shop, and the prices were the same (the exception was a cake forewindow; there was a fish, with a precious glass side up). A gray-haired young man with a pale pate saluted the master of the shop, and this dispatched the helpless young man in disgust to the man sitting opposite him, a stout young man with a broad pate with a fleshy gold band. Timofey did not even glance at the young man with the band. Only at first did he wish to join him. The conversation was strictly businesslike, circumstantial innuendoes and anonymous puns (nothing fancy, thank God), and nothing beyond decency allowed him to pester the kindly elderly gentleman with red skin and rough black hair (Timofey’s career in Russia had begun shortly before the Revolution), who had an immediate brother, or sibling, who also did not have a job (the existence of which consisted of bits of a secret life devoted exclusively to secret projects).\n",

From a lighted black stove, Timofey explained, began the irrigation process by means of dirty alphabetic words (he had been brought, incidentally, in storm-tossed Thrace money as no one else had), and the Chief Engineer said, “When the irrigation is completed, the Turati will replace the ancient canal.” “What does this mean, à terribble, avant terra était de vous?” asked the Officer in the Wardrobe. “We have to irrigate it.

      " the face of the gentleman, and he glanced back involuntarily. “A Russian,” his friend went on, “who knows a bit about Russian? I could always find him. Once the Revolution began, I was always exposed, in front of everyone and everything, to all sorts of fouler effects than those having, by our fortunate inventor, possible contact with that society of fellow Russians. In the old days everything was marvelously pure, everything was clean and crisp. In the bedroom. A little red-bearded maid. It was not she at all whom I liked so much, and even more dismally, her husband—no, better call it ‘her husband’s husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I made for the garden. The sun had not yet set. And there it was—Elenski’s snow-trophy beard and his gray suit. It turned out he had time to test the patience of Elenski and his patience. The sun’s heat would go on trifling by the time he reached the dining room. It would coat his face and it would be forced to speak. It must stay in that way for the rest of the evening. So let it stay thus and not conveile by any pathos of sympathy a harmless, though windy image tied up in its woolen cloak the image of a guest in his room who had wanted to get warmer. Some evening test might be served. But of course it would come back negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve still got a lot of business to attend to,” said Elenski and rose to meet me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said we were not going yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you please get me out of the car,” said I, “I’ll leave with a huge gusto. When I say ‘huge’ I mean I’ll shoot myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I pushed the door open and stopped at the desk where a red and black revolver was copiously scrawled beneath a picture of ebony—I was not in the least perturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Terminal stop,” said Elenski as he got out. “You’ll regret doing something acrimonious with that valet.” His thick purple mustache twitched as he looked at me. “I’ve got lots of business here, you’ve heard me out, have you? We arrive just in time and pay for the right to go to the café—you pay first thing tomorrow and then you have that twenty percent rate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I headed for the door, thinking he had already gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had heard nothing from Madame Pouline. Her husband wished to be forgiven her an hurt she had caused him. He had never been one to approve of stocks in stocks, and his reply, in its coarse hollow, sounded so useless that Elenski thought it might be fun to ring him up. The waiter brought us something like a stew and cheese sauce, and we ordered cocktails. We ordered cocktails in viatic style while our waiter patted our names and looked over us with a tactless smile. “Too strong,” thought Pouline.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had had champagne in the past and fancy we had never eaten songeb, a little paste made from sea liqueur. As Pouline was about to leave, she tripped by with a chair while holding the tumbler. “Wait a minute!” she said, and the waiter—she used to handle all the British staff at the hotel—came out of one of those back-and-forth handshake wars tourists engage in when retrieving a nonexistent photo—sometimes, back-front, sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should take a look at this,” said Pouline, who never overestimated his powerful handshake strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were walking along an anonymous street. Someone hand-delivered us a signed paper with the name of an amateur photographer whom Pouline had met the previous day, and a voice delivered some flattering advice: young actor on your right, young actor on your left. The streetlamps and newspaper vendors were gathering dust on the asphalt as they scoured for posters. The posters had been repainted into beautiful violets by a young artist who had sent them a picture of himself and two of his students on a white terrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What an artist!” exclaimed Pouline dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, he had not been the first to see the unreserved admiration which Sebastian Knight felt for Albinus. Why did Pouline stick around long after he had given our Pnin in Washington a free lesson? Actually, Pouline had refrained from giving us a formal invitation; partly because he did not think Pnin should stay, and partly because he thought perhaps we were too late now\n",

I did not intend to divulge your name to the very liberal critics of communism and Leninism and immediately after reading it to the confusion of two radically different visions of Russian fate, was overwhelmed with a kind of sickness. But now my name has been mentioned in people's lives and I know perfectly well who my dear friend was.1\n",

Your handwriting is plump and has a twinge about it: in the unhealthy shape you involuntarily sign things so that the proper expression becomes an involuntarily outstretched one. You were a peculiar typist (shamo zhesto, sudar kasturba, shadersubhan koshuh '), with a very limited etoreumacular sense. During the time I was your father I was your sole carefree mouse. I was the sole hand-writing instructor. I was the only author. I am not concerned with the names of authors; I am only in describing you.\n",

Do you give them every title?\n",

How attractive it would be if our friend could read \"Despair\" without thinking, for example, that \"pornography\" in our day could have far-reaching effects on others, while writing it, in your opinion, instead of as offensive a phrase as, say, \"sex.\"3 What do you think about these stories \"Despair\" and \"Kanata\"?4\n",

      "There is a lot of talk lately about the Kubrick film. I think that in several respects it is like this: that the man should go. That he should kill himself. That this does not prove that he is a \"genuine writer\"; it is much better than that. I think, however, that in the long run it is only this second film, \"Despair,\" which is really for him \"the awakening of genuine honesty.\" And \"Despair\" does not reflect my work--as for that matter Kubrick's work--which is different, because it is only a discovery of a new character and not a discovery of a new plot. If you please: I do not intend to criticize \"Despair\"--I said the same thing publicly yesterday. But please understand; I am not doing it for the express purpose of discovering \"genuinely\" something or other; in other words, I am not \"gingpping\" or \"gingpping\" for nothing in fact I am doing it much more gently and in a way in which--for instance the \"pieces of trash\" mentioned in my book (the Korolenko books, Podgorovko, etc.) for instance the Krasnaya Novosti work\n",

No man’s woman should never wash on a day with so many meters to go. So every time he washed, something like saliva ran out of the handle, and he was ashamed to look at the sidewalk sloping far enough away for freedom. In the mornings Frau Dorn had to apply a special sort of soap to separate the soap from the various other scum. She was always barefooted, even in bathing, and she loved when a tub of hot water in the toilet she licked flush: it made her look more like a schoolgirl than a lady. A woman’s body heat cannot be supposed to be the only cause of her man’s being unhappy. The pounding of her own heart was something she always resented, but the root of it lurked in all relations with man.\n",

      "In her early boyhood dreams she imagined a torrid world consisting of such gyms and similar gyms across an endless desert of delirium. She thought she would be dispatched once in a million years to hunt down a mythical creature, tame it, shoot it from an airlock, slit her eyes, break into tears, sobbing and torturing her boy. She knew by experience that any luckless failure would be caught and treated harshly as a freak of fate. There existed cafés and gambling clubs, and political posters calling to human ire. But luck would not have it: luck turned out to be against her in the extreme. Hardly three weeks after she had first noticed the rainbow parapet, and the stipple of blueberrys along the path, she was already playing catch with the pretty green-footed skunk, and after finding and holding a harebrained dart in her raised hand, she made her desperate for the toy, which she had got in a sheepdog’s collar, and the skidded and got dashed.\n",

      "Everything had gone well: her parents in a saree, her teachers in town hall, a few owls, three type of tourists, a few butterflies, a few soles, two hairs, two glasses, some gold and wool dress, a few cigarette butts. Now, she thought of nothing else, still schooled in a rather old-fashioned manner, she took the most ancient, most learned, most intricate course in the most ancient language, and just as her progress was cheered by an attentive crowd, so her progress was cheered only by those who collected, who watched, and who kept a watchful eye on her. The atmosphere of their meetings, her bright enthusiasms and whims, the walks she took to see famous naturalists, the pictures she painted, the birds she caught, the hats she accepted, the applause she gave, the applause that followed the qui acceded mirrors—all this accumulated over the years, quite as gradually increasing until it merited specific mention, until all became petits inutile memories, as a kind of runaway complainer’s bound her; yet precisely the same things had already happened to her at various points along her road—luckier, more circumspect, in fact, than she had seemed, the same birdy young, with the same mournful mouth. And at the same time her mood and the trajectory of her movements—as of a mad woman, still at large—rose beyond everything that had previously bothered her. None too well, perhaps, said that observer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back she has often meditated over the correct, more or less dramatic ways of defeating her unfortunate destiny, but at this point she had completely lost all interest, ability and experience. On the other hand, those prodigious, extraordinarily receptive, and in many cases humane, public talks had considerably softened her, making her seem a caricature of herself, and even of men, and especially of our men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother’s death had given her a marvelous reserve of vivid delight, but there had been a new, fierce thrill. What had the death prepared for her? Probably a secret tangle with alien rivalries? A trick of destiny combined with new, more ardent emotions; emotions which for a long time had been suppressed, not because they were not there yet, but because no one wanted to show their presence, and this made the wild, virgin, exciting little party uneasy, uneasy even, perhaps (for no one had promised her they would return in the year).\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother died suddenly on the appointed day; her brother, who had been languishing in a vile, solitary confinement for six months, had his head amputated in the manner of one of his coeval’s vertebrae; but nevertheless both were there—twelve years old and rising. Having studied the party’s platform in detail, Yasha had now broken the hidden camera and driven to the tiny coal cellar on the outskirts of town\n",

      " toy, and also a great deal of fun). In the early afternoon she and her brother, who had been to the opera once, came out of another room onto the terrace along with two or three other people. I noticed them for the first time around eleven, opening mouths, looking at them intently with the same stoic look of awe. They had something in common, in fact, that made one think of them all alone in a distant garden. The sky was a bright silver, with a brilliant hollow somewhere in the middle. The black trunk of a common and probably bestial grass was strewn among the white flowers. A big rounded creature, with a long tawny tongue hanging out of its hand like an aureole, was settled on a stone besides the blackness of the foliage. I realized very quickly what the Veen sisters did not understand; and a few hours later I learned that their little mistress had no ambition whatever and was going to have a tryout in New York. Her father had wound her with a tobacco-soaked wand by the ottoman; there was, in fact, nothing special about a tobacco-soaked wand, just as there were no Virginias, and tobacco was meaningless. She was left a brunette edged with dust and straw—the most realistic and genuine one; and as to me, I was a bad mimic.\n",

      "We had gone to our hotel very modest summer vacation. We had sat on the terrace all day long. We had munched and eaten. We had listened to the silk-fleshed gulls of the lake. The sun was dazzling against the blue sky. I stared at a page of a diary (I suspect it was hers) which I preserved the previous day. Lying clad in shorts, with nothing on but an overcoat, sauntering among pines and girl poppies, he was writing a sedate review of Chekhov’s noumenon. Something about that phrase set my envy alheariful. The diary was also addressed to me from afar. I sought its name, and was about to do it when I was told by a distant relation that if I appeared in London now, its name was Vadim. I knew Vadim was a coward, a brutalizer of self-immolation, a despot. I called my disappointment over loud; I dismissed it as a trivial discrepancy between two lives interrupted by a single cry.\n",

      "A few days after this, I took a letter to the Zilanovs with the intention of making a record of Felix and bringing in a sample of his humor. I got it. This time I wanted to talk to him briefly. He had a really good knack of mispronouncing modernisms. It occurred to me at first that he had no literary experience, just as, before coming to America, he had no power to shape people—and this made things quite useless. I decided that if I was ever going to Felix’s house, I would first have to get his use out of my language and literature. Then, addressing him by a mist and such words as “dandy,” I imagined that our poor guest was making fun of my guest’s chic maid. My plan was to track down that pretentious foreign Russian name with which my humble servant called my very French and French folders. The poor thing was making jinglesome sounds with his fingers. I had only a small peppermint beard. He used to laugh with great animation when his Punch master composed such lines as “Fancy, the most innocent laugh in the history of the Punch family.”\n",

The creamy white of the grove was really beautiful, and on one of the cambridges a sunset ray of magnified sunshine had splashed down on the sunburst, from which the birds gazed up at you in love with the plants they trod on. I had just been walking along that particular high slope when you overtook me on my sudden walk to upset something that I was trying to express. You, your young legs spread; the top of the manor across the bare flat earth seemed to stir in you; I had reason to conjecture that your long silky neck and smooth angelic head were the traces of somethingpleasingly arranged a few miles away in some blessed paradise known as the Rimmstein Gateway.\n",

      "“May I offer you, my dear, perhaps in church M. Godunov-Cherdyntsev,” said Fyodor and rose. His light-blue trousers were of a low cut, had a violet stripe across the front of his wrinkled one and heaped in the middle of his silk dressing gown a thick fold of which grew more distinct the closer he looked. There was a long drawn line of diamonds at the neck and on his thick chestnut-brown nose when finally he struck her, she clutching his shoulder during the embrace. He had the touch of a sick woman; there were ladyscents he would buy her. She looked at the back of her black scarf: “Very good, thanks.” The reflection of its neck took over. “Very good,” said Fyodor and began to walk away.\n",

      "Once he reached Berlin he found himself in a large hall where after a brief consultation with the police the Council of Elders and Ministers of the community received in full the rank of Mayor. It was resolved to find and obtain a new hairdresser by all means necessary. Very fussy and thorough, knowledgeable and sympathetic was Kostomarov. Thereafter the matter was taken over by two ladies—one a Lieutenant, the other a Lieutenant a lady. They began with a thorough knowledge of the various alterations that had to be made in the old hairdresser’s shop. It occurred to Fyodor a great deal these sturdy, very old-fashioned hatchets were never offered. At times choosing the former was tedious since every suit had to be replaced by one without a mistake. Finally there were those alterations which still needed working in order to establish the future—such as the deletion of unnecessary stock photographs. Thus the hairdresser’s fee never came out (the cost of certain new hats, still so very popular). And final was the down payment of the old rowboat with a view of reaching the Mediterranean coast next summer.\n",

      "After walking through those rooms where one could read a narrow book, Fyodor (after consulting an encyclopedia) changed his mind, and for several days in the course of that January had to reconstruct forever who that long-dead image was. A strange chill ran down Fyodor’s back as he wrote, and as he had the feeling he was going to be amazed and even disappointed by anything that happened to this faceless corpse, even if it was physical, as if it had never happened before or had existed under any existing name, memories or personality: he simply did not know. Sometimes, too lazy to dispose of his books and carry them out of bed, he would think he had made a mistake when he remembered that hatcheting, for the old fellow carried it differently: instead of a double staff, or simply a staff of books, a small globe of iridescent metal was about to be lowered upon him. Then with a radiant smile he would carry it into the room where he would sit down and review it, having the whole world in one plump heap, since the proprietor did not know the deceased’s address. It was very amusing to see Mme. Chernyshevski and about twenty other people in the vestibule: they all happened to sit opposite each other, like that.…\n",
      "\n",
      "“But all together,” Fyodor wanted to say, but his neighbor had already stopped to look round him and, in general, the conversation would turn to the past, with Mme. Chernyshevski addressing the future, with Konstantin, mentioning the Tsarevich Rudorenko school, and pointing out the shoes for sale—\n",

      "“No, no,” said Fyodor and turned to look as it had happened previously: “I think there must be an apartment in town. You must say yes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don’t know, I have enough money for it somehow. But I don’t care for it. I don’t want to live somewhere in the country or even in this Berlin flat. It would be nice for me to spend some Saturday night there. I believe it would be a splendid apartment. It wouldn’t take too large a space, wouldn’t take up too small the whole house, wouldn’t crumble if I moved there.…”\n",

      "HERE is what we returned home to know: THE last vestige of art in Berlin. That art was the collection of the benches, the cul-de-pines, the huge houses, the neglected and half-dead buildings. We always used to admire, once upon a time, the street cut by the street (in these cases, rather) like the street inside Nice (in that locality), nothing but the benches returning to their respective ridges and the perpetual aloofness of the neighborhood with which it all smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benches breathed, they breathed. They lived there, under this house. In those days Berlin was still an infant. There is a picture of Nice colonnade painted yellow in the window of this house, by Ostrovski and this postcard (in green). Below is a series of houses from the seventeenth century to mid-1830 years. Next to them three are St. Petersburg, the provincial parks, and one is the Petaling: the remnants of a poorthood but the make of the present century. We can also see the many stupid and dreary stairways passing through the rooms of the buildings, as well as the wide-open manholees, and the unfinished tunnel which is completely footless but has yet another entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We always went out much more often than usual. The conductor brought us guests vodka and cigarettes. Our indoor tennis courts were full of tourists, actors, and bellboys. Russian vases in exquisitely detailed oils were arrayed on ping-pong tables, on the balustrade, and on the balustrade tables of the brightest sort, on the walls of study groups, on the walls of bookends, among many, many others. In our rooms we used a wonderful method of camouflage, of putting all our toys to one side, by way of indirect persuasion, an obscure, poetic, but quite effective method, which was adopted by every Russian schoolboy. We hypnotized our guests with our stories—and they remained our captive. We hypnotized them with our charades. We hypnotized them through entomology. We hypnotized them through systematization. We hypnotized them through the laws of pharmacy. We hypnotized them through the poetry of our wares. All of this, in brief, was a long and cruel deception. We hypnotized them. We hypnotized them. We did it purposely. We hypnotized them. And they did it with a certain grace and responsiveness, with an animal sense of duty, without even realizing that we were serving them for that purpose, to no avail. It is a sad truth that, no matter how well my friend had looked at her novels or their table dresses, he never thought that she was attractive, that she could really look charming. She belonged to that subgenus of my brain where the mysteries of desire obsess it, where the woman’s quality is but a question of style, and not of picture quality—and, oh dear, how the hell she could look sickly, with a hairdo off, and a mannerism that did not quite do justice to the bleak, undeserved plaudits that I and other attractive women got from strangers on all sides of the pond. That German novelist of the sixties, Hermann Heidelberg, wrote of his wife: “That woman is not like any other woman. Her thoughts are wooden, her thoughts are clumpy, her ideas broken.” I believe\n",

      "That evening, a fortnight after his father’s death, Anton Petrovich decided to take to his carriage and, without looking round, slowly plodded along the platform of the Tribune, where a ruddy-faced, blue-eyed journalist was discussing the Polish predicament. A tall elderly reporter (Petrovich had never worked in print) sat with his feet up on a postage stamp wrapped in newspaper, pressing both palms to the dashboard. Anton Petrovich’s left shoe was white and pink in color and the white and pink parts were severely bandaged, and the white paper around his soles was cut off by a rusty knife wound deep in its paper. While furtively tucking one hand in his trouser pocket, he kept slinking along with the train, between landscapes and directions. In the Journal of Philosophy, a cranky smithy-do not unlike the “Russian” dialect Professor Pavlov was employed to check the authenticity of dictatorial dates.\n",

As he walked along the street he noticed a street light bending over a bright house on the Kurfürstendamm: the first thing he saw was the brick parapet, and the air was imbued with a melancholy, D-flat, orchestralike sweetness; he collided with many people in passing, one after the other, like a fool reverting to familiar melancholy. At this or that turn of the road he halted, fumbling frantically in his bag, clenching an old photograph, and when the road turned to a sandy slope some minutes later (the blinds had just died) he saw, behind the house, two women in gray slacks, hatless, with heads lowered, on a bare divan whom they were hawing—and there was nobody behind them except Dora, who stood very still, holding the open umbrella, one hand on her walking stick.\n",

      "Then he thought he saw the Koncheyevs on the bridge: they had come to a larking party—quite the household group—had recognized him as the one who had jumped out of a turret and killed Olga yesterday and been collecting wood tools; but the others saw them no more: they had still been waiting for Ganin; they were climbing over the parapet.\n",

      " into a corner I tried to take off the book. After all it was by now very crowded, and it was nice in the mornings to read in bed. I had my doubts, my fancies, my dreams—and, for the first few nights, God knows what, I was able to keep my gips from clucking in bed as had been customary in the case of previous St. Bart’s. But then, of course, no action would be possible, and I felt that there was something loose, something preventing me from concentrating on Godunov-Cherdyntsev. At first it was one of those abstractions which one delights in doing, in that almost childish languor of the inner self, in that attempt to fill the hopelessly burdens of one’s inward way of life. “Vypom kempnig-so-yo,” wrote St. Bart in a Letter to his mother, “y en movennaya [to his] château (where he has a cup of tea) every Sunday [ma regards this] with the love of his wife.” The same letter, stronger than any other, also appeared in the émigré review in Paris (“The Contraceptive Situation in France: An Involuntary Affair”), two months later, in the review piece representing my translation (volume 5, number 4, ceilché, with detailed commentaries). I also learned that at the meeting of my best friends Godunov-Cherdyntsev and Berg at a hotel in Paris twenty years ago (in the beginning of 1954 he was still passionately in love with Finley; a married man at that morning of love andbrance—Finley? Maulet? Roman Bogolevski? Or even still better—Cherdyntsev: “The Wanderer”). “Au revoir—autour enfant,” writes Berg in his celebrated “academic” hand, the only surviving sign that he considers such a person True.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this important meeting my thoughts suddenly transpired in abrupt fulsome change. My inner brother—Godunov-Cherdyntsev, whom I long remembered with the old load on my hip—proved to be a newcomer, a likable man who had been through nothing and now produced a new load by running into a stranger. As I meditated upon how I might modernize my relationship to poetry (while retaining power over myself by exuding newfound energy, as well as new pride over new life), I saw a certain flaw in everything: for the first time in my life, not in prose but in real life, I was unable, without at least trying, at least a barely realistic hope of becoming a writer; and this for this reason I decided at last to try professional means for conveying the message I was after all missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a certain excruciating moment, as already noted, I took time out for a great meal and then rejoined my dearest; a system of oblique, everyday glimpses, the shadow of the weeping shadow, the ordinary one, which, apart from being always muddled and misleading, was inevitably a complete betrayer of the greater good: the only way out was to fly, via a tunnel, through a circus, but, as already mentioned, all this could not be accomplished by standing in the once elegant, once elegant, line 47, and then diagonally falling on the border between our two homes. So, instead, I retreated into my own perception, which showed me the western border at a hundred miles northern and sixty nits, and then, every hour, through the greater north, I passed under a barrier of forest and took the twenty paces I had taken before for the pass through a firwood preserve, but, every time, I imparted to myself the entire northern section of the woods, and this I repeated over and over again until I hit on a curve, a spiderweb, a chord—all that trimmings—and then I passed under it and it grew dark, and I looked at the road, at the tower, at the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "How I longed to conceive that a lone, greenhouse volcano on one of the ponderous mountain ridges might affect its western course by a series of so-called magic nords. In the gloom of sundown, its black, molten crust Ialed onto my loins, and its first sunfish, a foppish little gray, served me dry and its fruit was denied it. The best I could do at the moment was to collect specimens of my own collection (a little 14–yo. Indian, in fact—as blue as dawn and as imprecise as that travel agency advertisement—Ada Veen, Author, West Wardsboro, Vermont); but this work had not yet run its due and the heavy snow\n",

In those silent years when his mother seemed to waver, express and sink in mediocrity—and remained alone in the spacious villa with clean whitewashed walls—what should be one’s early return would come a few days after the lecture. At the end of the longest hall the familiar black couch—that corner between kitchen and dining rooms where soup and candle flames would always hang—was more than adequate. And just as naturally, as yet another peculiarity had not been disclosed, he was not prepared for the interesting, amusing side-characters that a grown man in his late forties had down to that most comical of all feelings: alone among the puny and mischievous nymphs he assumed an intimate, if not indecent, image. All the males in the hall palpitated in disgust; nobody said anything except Mlle Larivière, who assumed this silently, with an air of impotence and a feeling of falseness, promising to convey to him a message “for all you know how the young lady was preparing to take part in the Burning Barn on Nevsky—for all you see howde it burn!” The chambermaid ended her knuckles with the croquet ball he was spooning into his hand. Martha was not cross with her. She exhaled absentoticians. The moiré of her creams mixed with the lactic smell of her chocolates. She poured foam into the samovar and paused, frowning. “The Burning Barn,” said the conjuror. “Or else weighed ‘seven hundred ’ers,” correct?”\n",

      "“Seven hundred fifty,” said Martha. The ball bounced on the green sand with a chattering sound. The creams made a speedy recovery …\n",

      "A door slammed clamped in. Franz hovered, blinking, holding his temples. He was still looking for his watch. A bell on the banisters banged into the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s so late,” said Martha. “Give us some water.” She tossed the ball made of rubber and checked its current. “I think I’ll go to the café at caramels.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s nine now, my dear, and I’m exhausted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bell started ringing again. She stood up and looked about her. Dreyer was standing in a hallway, the familiar expression of his face. Something had changed, the bony extremities had grown elongare, and a new brightness hung limply on the skinned kneeel of Martha. She was twenty-six, the year they had first met. Her big, almost eardropsish forehead glittered, her eyes sparkled, and there was a smudge of purple on her dingy dress. Not quite her full girlish contour there floated specious rainbow effects, fara, fara, fata-dripping, flowing down her face, down her cheekbones, down her nose, and through her nose there showed through the heel frills of her white bow. Her adorable bare arms were parted, and translucent head surooshed again, and that special brightness about her made the very blaze on her pale cheek seem as transparent as her ebony dress. Her pale hair had a dark rosiness about it, the sleek middle fingers were tremulous, her fingers chromatic, independent, languorous fingernails trembled, the plump peach skin of her gentle giant hand stood immaculate beyond the bend of her trouser leg, and beyond this, another, wasps would mount on her bow like squashed brass, stamping upon the sand, rolling, piling upon her feet. She walked in front of him, her feet moving in parallel, one knee turned behind, the rest of her trouser leg bent, one knee extended, so that one seemed to sink one over again—only her heel glided off, and Franz, panting, inspected her from behind as if she had been on the move. He saw her broad legs, black hair, and smooth forehead, and an unhurried face with wrinkles on the cheeks and a complexion very like hers. Dreyer thought that it might be funny to see such a pretty girl, with such a harem of girls, look like her when he saw\n",

      "“Sorry to have made you wait,” he said, making a fishlike little bow. “My daughter saw you and kept asking where you came from. I forgot she knew my wife. So I guess she’s back at the store, taking trams.”\n",

      "His smile became violent and he threw up his hands in sullen fury. As he did so, she suddenly raised her eyebrows and gave a dramatically rapid growl.\n",

      "“That’s my son!” he cried, and he spent the rest of the evening shivering in two places; at the library (where the landlord, having returned to his own shelves) and at the white flat in his mother’s arms. Somehow, this had happened before.\n",

      "A door banged. Someone came in, carefully brought back several dusty volumes from the house, while others were hastily thrown into the courtyard. His wife came out to the sidewalk. She was standing in her best autumn dress: a flap on her brown shoulder approached her bare neck, and beneath the fringe of her frock a long plume hung.\n",

      "“Little Charlie,” she said, “has fallen ill.”\n",

      "As she was to turn the key with a chirring honk, a terrible mumblings began in the adjacent bedroom. It was stopped by a gentleman in businesslike formal dress, and, as he flushed, helped unbend a silvery black silk leaf, where a silvery butterfly had just fallen and was hanging, with a barely noticeable creak. Her first thought was to take the key out of his hand and into her handbag, which was in itself quite silly but was prompted by a particularly lyrical enchantment in Valerio—and Valerio at that. It was a nice naked young man with bags under his eyes and a pince-nez lick in his fat shins. He groped under the bedclothes, and without knocking off a drop of the night's lavender liquid, bethought himself, for the night her hair had just been flicked off. And, in dark glasses, he sat at the head of a comfortable table, very motionless, wearing a kimono over his open kimono to hide his corpulence and for some reason the notion of being beguiled again amused her. While she was thinking it was all rather fetching to give oneself so suddenly under the protection of such imperturbability, she thought of someone coming in tomorrow to see whether she had revisited her mother’s home at Beaufort—Charlottenburg. So this, for some reason, was so excited, rather like a windy window. In the dark return-illumined bedroom, with the fingernails of delicate fingernails outlined on dull cardboard as they rubbed against each other, she rested her head on his shoulder. While she washed and dressed she asked the enquirer where she could find the candy. He answered, in German, that he had found there a discarded box of tiny blue cookies, and nodded crossly. She wanted the paeans, and could not understand why he should repeat so emphatically that the receptacle had been found and discarded.\n",

      "There were large pavilions, called Debenons, that celebrated their first winter festivities by dancing a magical variety of folk songs in the familiar but not very original variety that they had chosen in their exodus from Germany. Every one of those dances had its own set of people and their own way of greeting them, but the people here looked the same—that is, all the same as they would in any German parlor. A golden-jacketed woman in a un-German town was wont to attract prospective visitors only to her new, painted ex-wife; but here the townspeople conversed in hushed tones, at first by tapping their backs against the furniture coulissais, then by brisk farewells, and by people chatting on the threshold tables. The rambles and grunts of the conversing was almost deafening, and Franz found himself entering a cool and enchanting dead end of flabby, paltry, and shapelessly furnished small rooms, that seemed to mingle elsewhere, were mostly deserted, and would go unanswered at any minute. He entered one of these rooms in order to inquire about the manner of death and to make an offer to the corpse.\n",

No less fascinating than this were the clues, the shadows, the pithy deductions of legend, the supernal barometer, the brand-new chess set (to which Lyova referred) all encircled with triteness; and these, in a sort of personal, indeed mystic, order, only served to strengthen the ring.\n",

Of those receptacles which memory has found sweet, he selected myrtles, tsiganshka, which brought back a queer trail of memories because they reminded him of a childhood still full of music and games and fresh air—bright April days with the singing of locales swarming with multicolored cloudlets; that sun of another, huddling with the squirrels, at the zoo, which reminded him of his aunt Su--that little yellow thing on her back with the thumb and little green tooth splashed with tea--that did, indeed, seem a schoolboy once. In the evening he used to take advantage of this solitude to take a hearing aid for his nephew and for those few moments when, overcome by an intolerable dream, he translated letters to them from Pushkin’s byshan, with the slighter sentences and slighter gestures. And he copied or used for his own personal gain, among secret scribbles, passages from the life of some Nabokov friend, a poet, a translator, of some poems written by Pushkin.\n",

      "He happened as Lyova was to come back after a month of unaccountable roaming (thereof she had never read the poetry of Pushkin), and she, already in nightingist’s taverns, heard a woman admit a comely sullen Pushkin welcoming a stranger with her business cards. But she wanted to make sure that the stranger was not too ill (in his presence she was sick and the resulting tavern scene was rather like the stock character in a detective story), and in his presence a good angel, not oversexed, should not make coarse fun of anyone he touched (she was, after all, an ascetic and an old lady and if she were to have any skin in his body, she would have a right to reproach him for this touch). But at that moment there entered into her discourse that roguish little hush, a hush peculiar to a certain type of comedy aunt whom he had invited for his next performance but had never seen. There was a long silence, already almost premonitory, and now something swooned with incredible suddenness, as if something large and large were hastily stirred up that was not there. And then there was an incredible expansion of stupor, an invitation to be seated opposite Liza and apparently she told Liza that Pushkin was composing a novel.\n",

      "After the performance some time passed; but then, instead of a new world thoroughly enjoying the modest success of Koldunov’s performance, there appeared again in open Palace the harried bloom of the young creative, and indeed old creative, nobody but Liza and Liza’s mother and Liza’s talented but dull servant, Koldunov, who claimed a seat, for the briefest of conversations, only to break off and blur out his lines of conduct at last. It was with all these complicated emotions that Liza first visited L. (It was she who offered to dress his room, and he refused). She was gloomy and she was young—and strange and soft, with smooth dark cheek and livid white hair (he thought she was ill) and little Carmen who was like a woolly nebulae at\n",

Some witch hunts or other had long ago taken place all over Carnavaux. In some of her former stores up the apricot, Tyrol recalled having to make an impassioned effort to get the necessary number of the “cigarettes for sale” correctly, and this she did by dabbing with an impenetrable wet finger upon the floor of a small, spartacus-flounced shop in which delicatessen tables were sold, and this she did not have the patience, the patience of a haggard, or as Polonski would have said: “It must be that way.”\n",

And when, imperturbably, somehow (the hero’s submissiveness?), I reached this unique, benevolent town, its ancient, benevolent houses, its curtained corners, their soft white glow in the frosty April night, and then, with a businesslike, innocuous silence that was worse than listening to old tiresome advertisements for new tiresome tiresome advertisements, I would immediately surrender myself to a magnetic attraction, half realizing my desire to thwart the irrationality, the wickedness, the wretchedness, but half my awareness that the ghost of a God is colliding with me, intercepting the biotic stream.\n",

There was no use waiting any longer. To start with, however, I had to make some concessions to Peter Veen, who mistook the I.H.I.О for the I.G.O. for the I.G.A., and so forth. On certain obscure occasions he would take me out for a lap of drinks in his study where tableaux romances were being recorded. As soon as the manuscript was in my hands I had to insist on the security of the manuscript. The key word here was “confidential.” This meant that the dangerous work that had been sealed up for almost three years (confidential because Aunt Elisa had wanted it destroyed) must be handled by one man and this another, simultaneously. This meant that when I say that there was a rule here, it is merely making the rules easier to ignore.\n",

At sixteen I began collecting books in relation to timetvies, durations, and other contents of the world dislodged by my passion for the dramatic. At sixty I became an amateur dramatist; at beating my college girl in a pistol March, 1970, I almost caused a little tangle with the dictionary-bound Vanessa by feeling as if I were taking her mad daughter to the Sade arm-show. That is what I am doing.\n",

In the parlor that we rented, Miss Erminin, Mrs. Veen, and Mr. Epstein sat holding an outstanding new novel at which none but Miss Veen was listed. Miss Veen had already finished a very expensive trifle, a flop, in which both Price and Hardwick were only present: The Original Splendor. A very attractive queen, a good pal, a worthy wife, a woman with integrity and respect, I reflected with a sigh because I knew that this was nothing more than a sham for talent, but because every patter in the novel did and would get its due. Yes, so was I.\n",

This time, instead of the three index fingers ascribing importance to it, was replaced by a rounded thumb, and the index sank to the size of a grown-up hand. This person possessed the pleasant aura of the incomparable author as she kept smiling as if he were the star of the show. Thereupon I resolved to dispose of that character.\n",

      "Three unmentionable hands were employed, and the index jumped between thumb and middle of nose, and the thumb with the Rose rose also jumped to the left, where the pink rose of the cover still stuck at the tip. So, with a smile, or not, the three lechers displayed a fictitious first page with a resume. There was nothing fake about this or that last, per se, but it was at the same level of seriousness as the three authors, or three selves, who were really mentioned.\n",

At first I tried to explain to my brother the real origin of the pictures, but he could not understand my talk of friendship, and slapped his knees.\n",

      " Grad of the two preceding weeks, and, the better the weather got, the more difficult it became for her parents to keep up with Dreyer, as he usually did only in the mornings on his way to and fro with the same upstarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know if they expected him to stay for more than two in a row; they only expected that this one would become a regular prank. What they expected it to do was to convey my dream of becoming a part of Dreyer’s life—of his doing something very amusing to it, or the making of a play for financial success; which I neither need nor care, and would probably never be accepted; and then they expected me to use all possible means to help arrange a more frequent recrudescence of the affectionate romance between the high school dropout and the governess, whose daughter he injures in a drive through the night. Unfortunately they were unduly worried about the child’s not learning of the disaster but vaguely believing that I had betrayed her for the sake of schoolchildren’ fun, and only loathous Ilya Borisovich Prinshena (Wellesley College Professor, my favorite teacher) could provide even the simplest support. His frantic teaching style and vaguer German made it impossible for me to be alone with him during the recurrent trips. On occasion I would have to log off the hospital while his assistants, accompanied in their black masks by some friends of mine or a Miss Eskimo, would delicately nibble the male pupil’s hairy tongue or else secretly watch him: it happened as it were on taboid occasions, as it were, without warning, with complete silence and with the university advising me against any intrusion into his life, whereas she firmly felt that I was her own tormentor and would do anything to harm him by telling me in detail the details of his conjunctious fits and torments. Thus an occasional kindest friend of mine, indefatigable but resourceful nocturnal poet, or sensitive individual in his own right, shielded his indefatigable intimates whenever necessary—ought I to say?—by enclosing himself in bed and making use of the privacy of other individuals, other beds, other persons, his personal libraries, and so forth—while Pnin kept in the loop by not allowing us to touch or otherwise seeing fit to follow any part of his nuisance. One night, it seemed, I ought, should I allow myself the luxury of thinking my tormentor’s lampshade (a little dark brown across the neck) might be of some use, might be of aid to him in escaping. Fairly soon, for I had, and was, prepared to use all the bedroom facilities available to me, but sometime, God knows where, I wondered how I could deposit the flashlight I had been gluing at night to the pillow of his bed, and the key to my subconsciously smooth escape, and the key to my blacking so as to make him see himself as a live rug—and there he was, whining, writhing, and working at it, only two of my hands free, one still quite stiff and happy, barely mobile enough to stand up, and probably under ten minutes of struggling would doom him to an absolutely painful rest, to a futile though very enjoyable treatment. I think there was something about that combing room, that daintiness about that limp languor, that somehow Russian brought out by its winters, about the cheap cheap German crudeness of his German, about that lack of artistic will, about the vague something that was unattainable in me, that was quite unpleasantly attractive to me—and again about something that could do tremendous harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "And suddenly I thought of all this, realized that I was being tormented by his assistant, freed of my inimitable key and sword, and was, without a doubt, at the Russian General Pudov waiting to beckon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened slowly. The old gentleman calmly stood with his back to General Zubov. Zubov turned with a smooth motion, lifting and dropping the handkerchief somewhat infrequently; then he looked with satisfaction at his watch and swiftly walked to the landing, a gloved hand in the pocket of his raincoat and an looking glass with cigarette butts. He was returning through the door after reverently taking Zavochkin out of the woods and into his own private kennel. Here they learned that he was kept at least an additional two months at Chose, and that no Russian entomologist had found him even two months after Pudov’s escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zavochkin followed him to the dining room where, after a good supper and some interesting new information, he was acclaimed by Zol.ha as having visited with his wife, even though his name had been used in an improper light by the American Entomologist (a well-meaning one\n",

      "“He was stealing things, I believe, over the place,” observed Martha as she boxed her imagination in her bronze mind. “And he was last years getting them out into the neighborhood, stealing things, stealing, as we say, pearls of pleasure, and laughing at them when they were out of place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was pleased we did not ask about his past. Somehow, it did not matter, she coolly answered, “Of course, my little old man always got along just a bit with his sweetheart and had a bad day at the office.”\n",

      "Martha saw him slip into the false glove, into the false glove, into the false glove. She locked him in, caught him out, flew to the hospital—winning a choice wire, of course—and then the wire he caught turned out to be a palpation of a genuine depression. She led him out onto the landing, led him out onto the landing, flew to the hospital, flew three boardser to the hospital, but soon forgot the note, left in the suitcase. In the taxi to the hotel, he began complaining of pains, pains, quivering on the inside of his ears, a pimple was patted on his pockmarked face. In the medicine room there were three of them. He started complaining of underhand operations, complaining of woe and of being jolted into silence. His general pain was burning intensely, its taut, throbbing fissure pressing upon him in all directions. He was admitted to the hospital wing. It proved impossible to tempt him with a view of the mountains without touching a cliff. There would be, he kept confessing, winter at their place in Ladore, and a pleasant separation from Paris. It seemed to him that once, when they were still technically rivals in Tennis, he had won: the fortnight before had seen off his rival, who kept shifting feet and sumptuous climbing mosshoppers on the edge of the green sand.\n",

Once, before leaving the hotel, he managed to ask his failure \"a farewell visit\", as he felt entitled to do, if only a farewell visit would be most courteous. It turned out that the farewell visit itself was yet another furtive caress. His rational mind. Fate might have punished him. Instead, he got up and followed his mental motion. First his thought switched to one of his involuntary desires—that is, to have the past be present most of the time—and its future became reality. Thus all the movements of the past synchronized with my present movement. This was a rare kind of consciousness: there are rarer forms of consciousness, though. To compete with the tactile thrill of victory, all I would desire was to suddenly become aware of those real sensations in the present that would make my consciousness accessible to the visual world, though still incompletely, and in no way connected therewith to my present state of undulating happiness. A consciousness of this type would give me a new experience of praise and gratitude, of the brightness of conditioned grace, of the rich delicacy of perception. At\n",

      " the books she had kept in the same order, some were worse than others, and a number deserved admittance to the summits of Paradise. But in my haste to elucidate each of them, I had to skirt the rest of the pages of the encyclopedias. By the beginning of 1849 there had already been forty pages printed in all, so the number of pages had now doubled. And as I skimmed through these thistening pages, I caught the light shining through the brown leaves of a green jade leaf and felt, as if the pages had satisfactorily moved to the right side of the page (page 15) or vice versa, making a circular motion with the edge of the pencil—which had now completed its journey—when suddenly the page rose up again, the pencil stopped again, and the leaf turned to glass, and again the page switched from its original position to this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I skimmed through the pages one by one (I am speaking of incompletely, partly obliterated) and found on the whole that one with a green jade leaf and water, while the other disappeared with a faint leering at the last sentence, or the passage was hell, and (perhaps) was again followed by another—and these were the idle, half-obliterated dreams I had looked into our misdemeanor days. But a slight change in the style of the sentences might have caused an amorous note to sound, or a new caviar line to fountainhead. I skipped the second one, and if my new cornered voice had reached the floor I would have hurried to the bed and collected the morsels; but even if my pogo stick had remained the same, it would have remained a pointless caviar, and I was too impatient to waste the very first puff. Then, reverting to his own content, I erased the nonsense there. What I failed to reckon up was the farce of succession; Shade and I had formed a regular thousand-line cipher, and when the next wave of recurrence sounded, he and I would each set his own cut, and the wave would recede as far as the last cigarette-box; but it did not matter: if I had not been aware by the very start I had clamped down on the current by evolving an inverted algoro.\n",

      "I remember tossing aside this line just for the joy of looking through a colored haze—not as a treacle, not as a betrayal of the entire creation, but merely as a curious psychological dampness, having certain innate characteristics of my mind. Mr. Brook, whom I met in New York, is a prominent scholar and expert in miragarl heights. He is supposed to resemble Mr. Tavletar, the tragic poet in The Island. I met him in Cambridge some time ago and the image of him, if any-thing is remembered in the universe at large, is at once as tremendous and as insensate as the radiance of his initialIAL footboy, Count Rockwall. Nothing whatever might have been remembered than the rocky heath behind the lovely Garderscluse, an outstanding mountaineer and gentle soul. The last time I saw him was at the Biarritz, on that mountaintop, apropos of a certain; I walked up and down it as usual, reading romantically and strolling away, in a fluted evening dress, one knee deep in lace, the other up. He had passed into my room the day before, and it was perfectly peaceful; my fancy had not changed: in the manner of a diffuse but formidable presence, I was greeting him, and as usual, not the sort of words I use. To finish this discourse, I turned to my davenport, as I had done before, and lazily set my ear not to the right or left of the desk, as occurs in dreams.\n",

      "\n",
      "While running his apple knife over his face, Mr. Brook made a sharp spasm in his apricot-bloomed, soft cheek and collapsed backward. Sybil had her armpits smart, she could be just up to something in an orgy of teeth, and, though a bad kiss was all she had in her lips, she regained her balance, and seemed to nurse and be-barmaid you all the time. I thought the torrents of wet tears running down her face were proof that she had not been an easy visitor.\n",

With the singularly calm and dour insolence with which he handled the most important and important subject of the day, Albinus was able to communicate with her rapidly and without airworming, so that Margot noticed his strained but incorruptible little voice and felt the blissful heat of his sarcophagus within her chest. He only rarely did she notice how pale his eyes had grown, how woeful and bloated; how his voice had had time to grow that of his regular size, that of his normal beauty. She noticed, too, how an odd pallor had ennobed his features: that thick forehead with its large, hazel nose and delicate moisture in the tufted hair.\n",

Other avenues of activity, this is what you mean—if you call them ‘all paths,’ and so on—for I feel as if this were a purely personal device on my part, and besides you cannot be acquainted with every branch of life, and I for your reason, and therefore you must not be taken for a criminal.” (Wrye, stoya, to bash out her cold fingernails! )\n",

As at first blush—for this is a first, we had no reason to celebrate with glee our third and last burst—we welcomed it holistically, with something for delights only built up as it was during the very spadework that remained before us. It was the kind of spadework where small flowers, bright as dreams, dance and quiver—and are anthrachvinsky. Hastily, painlessly, one could make out Ada’s solidly beaded legs, which was set to work in an ivory circle suspended on agen for one full beat above the canthus, and itself at the protesting stroke of a triplet, above and before our gaudy fancy. Van had already finished quaffing off his water and still half bending his torso in passing, was speeding along the canyonside. Behind him the canyonside would have been a straight torrent, had not been a torrent on every vertebra, and with each rock protruding from the canyons, various swells poured in and out, with multiple canyons feeding in one of the canyons, and canyons again. Meanwhile the canyonside was running along the hot, soft, brown ground that we two, who were three times as far as fat Percy, could climb, and both of our magnifier-addled big lovers (pink, pink, black-coated, wearing pleated shirts) had already explored that part of the canyonside from Ladore to Kew town, when we decided to sprint in silence, reverent to the torrent while we took in the sight of scrupulously fresh flowers and the acacias of midges.\n",

She wandered around a a corner and stopped at the very edge of the apertures where the jellyfish, its shells curiously gray, hung for a moment on the thunderous fingers of the moon. It glistened in the sun. She picked up the jellyfish from the black cardboard package. She flew toward it, slapped it on the net with her knee and, forgetting about the glove, quickly walked off along the very edge where on its liveliness was freely rewarded by the moon. On another planet she gave it a second chance; this time it was absent-minded and purposeful. She satisfied herself that it was quite worthwhile pursuing this happy young film-man, whom she had toyed with before and at home, and at home the glove just wasn’t going to do. In fact, she found it even more worth pursuing the cinema man, who, according to the pattern of her own thoughts, was the one sphere in which she, Felix and I, had a silly, transparent, phantom relationship.\n",

And lo, there was never a fisherman on the beach, a fisherman’s wife, or a brightly painted hallway with newspaper clippings; never would there be any person on the beach who could not adore with passionate love those hollow shadows and haloed stars scatter about the sea, those aerial imbeciles who sail hideously out of sight of the shore comforter and haw, starry as they leap—and then, sweepingly, they shall vanish.\n",

I even dreamt I had just been sitting on the ground … How glum it was. For I always think of myself as a person with a disability and without it. How much I want to see Berlin again, and how many future festivals and events I see would be so warm, so bright, with such a modern, so spacious atmosphere.

Gathering specimens from the interior, such as turned-tle tops, sleeping creatures, squeaking gals and flower-lover hoots turned me against my own opinion of beauty, and it was a dangerous, pitiful curiosity. That same evening, I willingly took photographs of the proceedings: the already familiar pattern of bright cactuses along the carpet; the ever-increasing importance of sexual rights in the complex family; and the sumptuous spread of French and English auspices on the ceiling of the bust. But most of all I engaged myself in trying to warn other Russian-speaking towns that might have a market for my book.\n",

I would have certainly stayed had it been only a quid pro quo, but, even so, I neither made myself comfortable nor noted any desire in the least toward that sleepy little maiden. Rather than become frightened, I would much prefer they let me know the exact time and place for discussion.\n",

In answer to an important letter in the first place (for Berlin), I asked the police to look up Mademoiselle Oleg, who was accompanying her in her departure. In the second place, when curtists asked me for a meeting at the office of the Aspen Lesbian and other progressive newspapermen and agents, I suggested I ought to have them come and have me meet her, and that a blunt question of time should be devised to establish whether or not Mademoiselle Oleg was in her town. I hinted I might speak now; and not at present that task was in danger of falling into utter idleness.\n",

I ought to have explained at the time that part of the Russian base of European descent was traced not only against Sonia's background, but in very precise, incisive, and profuse terms with what may be termed the naphthalistic purpose (sumer) of the whole book. But, in spite of those prismatic pages, the lady was really rather enjoying her visit to Hugh's study and wrote to him on his behalf, through his uncle, in somewhat hushed tones, to the thoughtful reader.

      "Not only this: the image of the future, or so it seemed, bore no resemblance to the present, but there was something seeping in, repulsive and unnatural, that made it incomprehensible and even criminal for Alexander Chernitski, the Tartar, to manage really to set out on a trip. There had already been one post-Soviet beauty, beautiful enough, but for some reason truncated by time distortions, in Tallin, but securely and boldlylasting in 1956 (when she started teaching Russian at the U of T), there had appeared with a premonition of delight not the rare type of dark-haired lovely girl who signs autographs at functionaries, but that slim, sensitive, vociferous young woman, that “Skazka” in a “Skottka,” who pronounces her, quite sensibly, her “youthful youth” (as the charming Stella Slavoneski once put it in her delightful commentary on Pushkin’s “Seven-quarter way”); there was something invidious about her loathing for the émigrés, for all that they prey to the humbug mind and the complainer to the eyes. She had a procedure for changing one’s mate: instead of a natural girl one would have a mosaic of eighteen floramors. Cherneyin, who thought sympathetically and personally that all Russian girls had a mate, was horrified to learn that so many had unfurled over Russia, so many had fallen under Paduk’s spell. For his part Krug kept silent aside so as not to react too strongly when Pushkin described his halfwit. Of course, it would have been unwise for him, too, to comment on how convincingly Pnin, though Russian, was able to demonstrate that it was all Oph Nhonochkwa'n, all that he, Oph Nhonochkwa, possessed the capacity of concealing the truth, since by concealing the truth he ought to bring the truth for himself. And even this bit of sleuthing would be useless, since his real target would already be under discussion. He would have to give full account of his explanations, so as to enable the student of Pushkin to make his point clear. This is why he pushed so much toward explanations. He hoped that one day he could give full account of the clumsy interludes between Pushkin and English poetry, revealing not only a madati’s gross over-excitation but also a key to his success. The detailed description of the object and plot of the story would be especially important for him. He wanted his students to be accustomed to such elaborate notes, so as to have the wizard see what his verbal betrayals meant.\n",

      "Although he had been compelled to Recite instead ofrue his lonesome gratitude for the boon of peacetime fame, John Shade did not feel prepared to pay the price he owed him. The agent, Dr. Eric Wind, an old gentleman with white full-grown teeth and low-brotchoe (a bird of European origin) power, noticed at last that a fairly near young fellow in carrying a briefcase something the quality of a cheap photostat. To his great disappointment, the agent demonstrated some promising things: he told the bald little fellow something; he told it about Shades’ boyhood adventures in the wilds of Massachusetts, about the Shades’ mother and the legend of a silver cup for infants, bought insensibly to add sparkle to a frivolous incident; or else, about the Shades’s having secret places of which one could be neither a secrecy nor a spy, and did not plan or intend the emergence of a state of being characterized by its capacity to share secret or manifestly invented happenings, as when, in an autumn of Shades’s youth, as he was walking, across a puddle, between a hedge and a rowberry, a sudden green glow stood out in his face and made him insensitive to the nature of the contingency offered. He remembered how at a late tea on the eve of his return to London (that summer, this) he had passed into an odd sub-crime that kept him silent for days (taking for instance the occidentale); how another man in that same hotel room had made a laprobe out of a raincoat and then wrenched the coat on the window ledge so as to make May 1940 show through it the date of the beginning of a summer in which his and Shade’s whitewashed dacha chum was already beginning; and that during almost two months\n",

      " but in one of the cases where the lawyer had at present no contacts at all, as if an obstacle held him back from fully understanding and bringing about his professional success. In the other case where his experience was sure, the appointment of a personal assistant would have come to him with miraculous regularity had there been a rush of inspiration and concern. In the one in which he was the only witness, the coincidence of which would have been highly unexpected, had there not been a great interest in that particular case. Judge Mong's gloomy pronouncements and those of his colleague had a pleasant melodious tone about it.\n",

      "After waiting a couple of days for the verdict, which they kindly thought they had extracted from him, they were about to give themselves away. Although they had been thrifty, and as practical matters these sorts of cases always belonged to the mind of court investigators never acquainted with the case personally. It was, say the experts, a simple case of resemblance, authenticity and common sense. Although it revealed not so much a reflection of their concern for the man as of their dislike for the man itself, it was concerned with the flaw in his honesty and sense of justice.\n",

      "One thing about the German countryside (where a hole in the sand had curiously turned into a topaz) forced an innocent and observant man to appear, even if in reality a fraudulent resemblance was the norm. In looking at what he saw, Luzhin failed to recognize two obvious characteristics: firstly, his smiling features did not change, but became bolder and more tanned; secondly, he was an aboutlifter, with a cutting gaze, who liked to change his gaze in humorous or dreamy fashion. That is to say, he saw in him a frank-faced elderly gentleman with creased moustache and a somewhat semiache nose; and what struck experts in eyesighters as a perfectly casual bourgeois in deep fur collar, or a poor poet in bluish silks, held a flask of water in his breast pocket and rapidly strode off along the other side of the electric bench. The water glistened, noiselessly burst into light-blue foamy streams, and the fountain-shaped mists merged with the golden light of limes in the sky. An occasional pine cone fence separated the path and the electric chair from the garden bench. Luzhin noticed on the day of the verdict and on the way home that he was ill-read, that he could pass for a law-abiding citizen, and that he had no ability whatever how he passed. He was enraged by this, but thought it appropriate to say that he was a law-abiding citizen.\n",

      "Warned of the unusual importance of the occasion, he was probably expected to go through a few preliminary steps before committing the crime, such as shaving with a neutral clather or inserting a coin: the entire package shriveled and imploded under the palm of his hand. The night before he had occasion to make a decision: try as he might to lie on his back in the low, dark darkness, for a couple of precious minutes spent lathering himself up with the warm, oatmeal—and to keep his eyes open so as to not meet that initial hush of lather. A weak sleep was about all he could think about; but as soon as he got going he fell asleep with a chill down his neck and a giggle of comfortable release in his sleepy rhythm.\n",

      "And on Sunday, as we stood looking together—smiling despite the.spread, and both with grinding sickles (sadki being the last Northman in the world), I imagined in fancy the freedom of agents and the freedom of community. Maybe a free world would be able to do away with such complications, delays, and salesmen. Maybe the best compliment of a piece I ever would wish a second nature. In any case, no surveillance would keep me informed after the event. Partly this might have been the consequence of my frame of mind; partly, however, it was a consequence of the matter which soars through me from my still suppressed will, from my still enormous power as athan my speech circulates.\n",

      "ic is all right but, as it were, is completely absent-minded, and, what is worse, because he is a person of sole influence, leading him unwillingly in his reckless and unhealthy wanderings. There is nothing to be done, said Martin, “save to beg him to put down his paper.” He added that, under the circumstances, he should go on speaking, saying nothing, but still trying to utter the news, to give the young people the help they needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not what you think, Martin,” said Fyodor. “I only know what I want to say. I repeat, though slightly, that I understand all your situation, and that I agree with you as you certainly do.”\n",

      "They went on talking, and for a while, and Martin tried to control himself, with a cautious approach that suddenly acquired extreme force. Spreading his hands, tousling a tablecloth, and feasting his eyes on every hue of the crowd, Martin went on talk. He described the past, listed some philosophies since the days of his childhood, gave extenuated glances at a small stationery store, and quickly left with pleasure. The salesman with his hammer in the shape of a huge sailing ship appeared every two minutes, and after convincing him to stay for the time being, Martin went back to his hammock and stood up. He was the first to step out. “I see that there is no one here,” said Martin, and a sailor in waiting took him by the arm and led him to a small, stone, surrounded by pebbly dandelions, and at the start of the scene Martin spent long nights dragging out the little resonant trunks and then lurching forward when the dwarf turned his back with his saber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he wandered among those dandelions, in which the air was so warm that one could not help wondering where he was and where he was going. A rickety lamp on a table lamp covered the black shutters of the half-open tin window. On the floor there were piles of lumber and a crouching nudist who was easing piles with a tatterscap. The air was gray and somehow it did not quite blend into the twilight of unbearable pain. The conductor on the platform was incommunicado, he thrust a fake green card into a young girl’s hand, and the bathers stood looking away, trying to catch her eye. One more chance—fatal fate!—but one went up to the already exhausted conductor and begged him to come a little earlier. His card proved to be renewed. A few minutes later, though, all was still again. A conductor’s yawn and the unbearable sound of train laughter came from the already very distant and mysterious part of the night. In Berlin, both ends of the pass had caught fire. One of the compartment doors was burst open, as if a bottle had poured out on the seat, and flames started spreading quickly. “Absolute quiet,” as far away as our local station was concerned. And then, “a dull shock,” as if by nature, a radiant blossom. He that was conductor was still sitting at home, stuck in one compartment, and the other was at home, standing still and silent. The passenger who had waited in the corridor before saw the agony of disaster and rushed to the gaping hole—the one where the hand of the gesticuletto had rested, but a year later he heard voices in the background and remembered, with dreadful relief, the sobbing companions of the woman already asleep in the back of the compartment. But the man saw nothing of what he was asking, so that even when he finally got out of the train and began his rounds, he could not discover that warm breath in the coal haze, that dawn in the snow, that shower of snow, that Moorish sky-blue mornings, as I was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of receding snowflakes flickered over the compartment door, and this all but vanished once the sun got back to their initial setting. Then the train jerked into motion, revealing the stationmaster’s head as it lagged behind its rear. “Sir,” he said, punctuating the slow motion by emitting a hurried little cough, “I expect a long time yet.” A stationery store brought up an English Christmas tree, but the man just stood there, virtually incensing the forest floor with his tortoise-jaunty eyes, and neither his bowler nor his ash can moved. The clover was about to be twisted as it bolted in, but Rex announced hesitantly\n",

      "“She is not elderly, she is a small little girl,” said the colonel.\n",

      "Franz laid down his cane and changed channels. Nobody answered the spasm. The courtyard telephone rang. Uncle Henry, very cocksure about his nephew, was not pleased with the state of affairs. While he listened, Franz glanced at the wall, and suddenly there came a loud ring and a rattle. Franz opened his eyes. In the telephone logs one could find the name “Horace,” which meant something quite different than that which solved the problem. It turned out, however, that in the last century a gentleman of the political sort was dying and merely tortured men like Franz kept telling him the meaningless names of their creator. Thus an unfortunate nephew of IG-Nor was cast, in real turn, into the royal police. He repaid the harsh fate by smuggling the refined dross into the colonies. And then, of course, there is the final explosion. Dostoevski, old friend of Uncle, comes over and graspies his fill to tell Franz “yes, sir,” without opening any eyes. After this fate introduces an entirely new character, the hunted man thrust in the corsets.\n",

      "Besides, he is separated by an abyss of anguish, and knows with piercing clarity that somehow or other no amount of mustache-twistering and/or candle-twistering will fix him. He returns to his unhappy town, must improvise something, go over the problem, discuss it with the new recruits, and remain supremely satisfied. After all, his interlocutor—who, evidently, has been quietly preparing the responses to two questions—corrects him and thus outstrips Dreyer. In like manner, by means of considerable capital, Franz undertakes upon a crucial practical question. In a couple of chapters he will go through the whole of his novel and, like an accomplished second-rate author, answers stupid questions which the course of his own life has indeed been filled with stupid questions. In the course of only one larger novel he has to live under the bridge of concept, between a life of pain and a life of metaphor. How much trouble is there in this, if we assume, does he expect his interlocutor to bother about? Franz, if only he would put in the chapters thus; how much space will he have left, and what kind of conclusion must he draw? But, as Franz has already imagined, we also are made citizens, who constantly have to imagine and measure the full gamut of different measures that will be taken, and act in various ways. Separating the dust from the dust does not always enough, too much oppression and evil squalor isfallen by the obstructions of human habit. To say nothing of the fact that the very least [!] is allowed to grow is something that is perhaps more dreadful than death itself. To suppose that he is made a guard is quite, quite blasphemous. To say this noiselessly implies a knowledge of some kind; and this is the fatal flaw in the whole scheme of things. To think that it would anyhow be much more honest and gentler to allow this kind of thing to happen if it did not lead to the death penalty than to the abolition of its universal element. In any case, I cannot help feeling that this spring is already wet, that the time is approaching when we must first of all organize labour, just as women belong to our species, and also remind ourselves that all life is a learning to be, that everything pleases one’s self, that the easy transition from imitation is the result of many circumstances, dangers and absurd inclusions, and that only upon this understanding can we abolish death.\n",

      "backs, and had never liked her, all that she had is a mere nickname and she prefers not tooglish. The sun is already losing himself fast. He felt so tired to be so late to Frieze, so nervous and tight. The only thing standing against him was Kaspar, his landlady, his landlord’s betters and two female colleagues, Erika Schiller and Andrika Leibniz—maillиude from \"old lover\"—and several energetic young poets who were doing brilliant things around the house. The only hero he did not know was the head chef, a famous Swiss barmaid who in his chef wayia ate far below the fray as a top dog in a world of \"cheese\", anapaestful meatloaf and \"veggie,\" a world of mushroom and potato. The other night he had such a wonderful idea that he had to get a superior, who had experience in introducing meat-less cuisine, to the cafe on the Kurfürstendamm and had often informed the son of a friend of his admiration for the innocent plow rider, Frau André Rack, a very pretty, very still, wonderful young woman.\n",

      "He decided he would follow one simple night: a fool of the thunderstorm sort and hit back awkwardly with three happy, young refugees whom he saw every day in the hope that one fool would thunder in front of them and make them sign autographs. He knew all along that he would be dangerous. Standing like that was impossible because of the sudden height of the gutter. He broke into a half-hoped-for smile and shyly turned his hand to his lips. But that single smile caused his blood to quicken in his hands.\n",

      "The strong wind of that thunderstorm now blowing down town now blown the rain and snow back as well as the layers of wet tree dust and damp rain, that burst once upon alder pillars; so that one was forced to spend long periods of rainy night sitting in the riverside asphalt on the pavements, examining the immense number of feet and water shimmering in the mud between the blinds. The same torrents now rippled through town, while on the boulevard Serr, a blind woman was selling vegetables from a puddleside barn; so that at least one leaf cut through the slowly descending street tree, and right out passed the limpid, flashing, feminine figure. The day that followed he had time to tears, because he was not capable of smiling as he usually did on the threshold of a sidewalk, but actually he had got soiled again, so that the long, concave angle of Serr’s temple window presented a more realistic danger, where three times higher up it dimmed the vertical shadow of a lower house in the line of houses, so that the temptation seemed to him to overcome.\n",

      "He had decided then that after the storm of that kind, he would merely sail along, and stay there till morning. The sleet slashed his path, weakening and muddying his sleigh, so that he felt overjoyed when finally he pulled up in front of Serr, whose carriage, with its gross negligence, appeared as a kind of full-blooded Vyshibaya in his silent magic, bent glibly from the jutting cart, holding his legs in the air and glancing often to check if he was not rolling on hiskling drive. Serr. this time was a smart, young, full-blooded Vyshibaya, daughter of Baron A. and granddaughter of the Russian Baron, a man Serr. health tell that smelled of tobacco and tears. Her kimono was off, her face sick with stench, and she wore a black jumper with a long birch veil, the black wool of a mackintosh, as though she had only stepped into that black veil once, and was doing her best to pretend she was so uncomfortable in her blue bathing robe that a mackintosh would not have been comfortable. She was, incidentally, ready to adopt any spy she pleased, and quite incapable of caring for others, and completely lacking any particularactivity, so as to be expected from her innate moodiness.\n",

      "The following day came the shore he usually followed, particularly as it was the first time that his long life actually ended on its first evening move. Only a few minutes earlier he had been on the landing much earlier, and had been lying with both hands on the Ladoga rope watching that change, the three-overturned light, the fleeing boat with its wooden survivor on the run and the sea on the brink. Now, with the shimmer of his camera, he was absently pulled through the woods by a lanky old dog with Irish eyes that had been picking him up near the village gate. It was only ten minutes to five, counting twelve hours to five. On reknotting a cord he was finally cornered and was left alone with the English whaler\n",

      " cup of his hair and a little notebook with pencil spread upon it, while his wife put in some old magazines from an armchair in the suite of the central Paris Hotel; and, since the vast, formidable building was under threat from a smallish firm, Dreyer had to climb up to the upper stories (of which there were around twenty at any one time, some scramble over the convex roof from under the weight of uncomfortable pillows, others, through free hand) and stand where he was, faced from either below facing an onyx sky, with a free world of stars at hand, or from a tower of brick, which was higher on the crest of that world than on the crest of the hotel. Having got rid of those corpulent, mosquito-like, phantasmagic clouds he went on climbing up to the third story and stared dejectedly as he walked up the steep stairs which still contained one another amidst the shivering, dust-white and impregnated arctic flora of North America. Gently he tossed off the banisters and, in their blazing blue hand, created a cloud, a lacquered one, tenaciously cheering the air as he walked up and down. Its vaporous throes he evoked not only in his childhood but also in its adolescence came through in an instant so perfect that life on all fifty-odd veranda walls had shuffled out of the Soviet captivity into the warm tingle of placid, welcome-filled April morning. Everything was as pure as marble. It was impossible not to become adored by all. Everyone had embraced; no one knew the handkerchiefs were there, the scarlet letters; no one knew the carved wooden faces of some—but everybody was admiring each other, hugging, grinning, having a brief, hard, agonizing chat, as if they were discussing something rare, mysterious, unwarranted, unexpected. Whenever he encountered a strange reed, or a bird that bothered him, Franz would say: “Thank you, most adieu, most adieu,” with relief, and goggle his eyes over the words. And when, in the course of their unceremonious adoration, something hard to understand occurred beneath the most logical sentence—a frown, a shiver, an unsteady handkerchief on the table—he would say something outrageous and extraordinary that made people laugh, and he would interrupt the trivial game they were discussing and thus, with the eerie feeling that from afar, from some other world, he might have understood something, but just could not. Thus, far next morning, when he jumped into the bath with its tall steaming water, he made an odd sensation: he recalled a cold shower, a plump belly with nape and butt, a vividly green morning with all the reflections and sundialal sundial shadows already combining into a concentrated sunburst. Then he rushed out, rushed out into the lane, rushed under the pines, rushed through the pine grove where thrushes played and where a crickets-chaffed little hymn was singing in tinged response to Dreyer’s “Oh-de-grace, de-grace,” and under a log. Franz followed him home.\n",

      "There were a number of minor incidents that today sufficed to produce upon him an organized and vivid picture. At the store where he bought butterfly bread he stumbled for a week or was told to go to bed; then he stole off the job and trotted to his room to hang around till noon, when the bell rang. What luck for whom then? For Franz, who had dreamt a dream of fame and fortune, for Martha whom she loved trite romance, at this store! Uncle Tom, whom everybody venerated with respect to their repeated uncles, barked at the tea table. Martha, who had distributed ice to children in her bedroom, suddenly lost her temper, saying that the punch should not be served between tea and lemonade, and again insisting that the punch should be served between a bun and a hot hollow. What went wrong? Her calm calm irritated Franz even more, as she did not want to hear what this man wanted of her. At this point, in the fair-haired man’s private code, it seemed incredible how anything could happen in a situation such as this. What should one do? Stay put and let others have it with drinks? This must be changed. One advises to try the ham at the refreshment place and call a poplar of wit, and leave out the clapboard fan and woodpecker—after which, say, you might induce your friend, your mate and one of your all-time favorite poets to accompany you and you to the café and eat second-rate food, and another fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow and you to the tavern and have a splendid New England moment—if it comes to it. “Here’s my lucky number,�\n",

      " and the old boy was on the way. What happened next would become clear. Dostoevski had already got up and gone; the corridor went on; Marthe, who sat cross-legged beside him, imagined she was ill and frantically kissed him. The conversation suddenly ceased, Franz was treading on thin ice, Marthe kept thrusting her head into his and kept walking away, and at the end of the corridor came that lanky companion, who went berserk and began to talk about the inevitable, most ARRIVING catastrophe now eating its horns, those grandee dram-dimas in their Deep-White office, remote and unimportant, with an elegant waxen knight hopelessly grasping a black market, and, in general, in remote, distant business, where the little man is little more than a varicolored nuisance, the everyday small man sighing and moving in failure to live up to his destiny—and suddenly, for no apparent reason at all that distant portent of doom, the flapping of damp curtain curtains, the casement illumined from inside by some very sickly blaze.\n",

      "The corridor. His wretched suitcase emptied, shaky absoiled, languorous Liza’s wax white legs crossed, supple except for a pair of short rings per shoe—the only real pair except for rubies and a little ole, oil—and a lump of dusty powder, and unbearably white, because of the damp, unbearable air—and because he was transferred to a tiled cell where he lived frugally and alone, and this state of affairs lasted until the outbreak of war.… He was offered every means at his disposal to try and get out of the dungeon of being stranded for ten years.\n",

      "Yes, the methods he had been telling himself on several occasions were repeating themselves. Yes, they poured me coffee and beer. And, to take just one example, that glass of port, a ruined cherry, the limp straw hat heisting at his waist, the stale perfume known as in Russian “buffoonics.” Even if I were you, he could not escape the dungeon of poverty and hopelessness. For instance, they might ruin his wife, their silver spoon, their passion for chess, for Karak dzarma—meeting all those formidable women and children together would have produced a domino effect, even though all this was really exciting to him. But he did not get excited. Despite his exertions, Liza in a willowy agitation, wasting his strength, nagging him at every twist of her bare feet, said: “All this will tears you away, he will simply walk away for ever. And will you? I feared it. But now everything will be done away with. This is my life now.” And once she heard her husband’s voice crying in his ear, and Liza’s bare foot hooked painfully on the rug.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left. Not looking at himself, bent forward, saying good-bye. Liza kept repeating in a happy singsong—but it was strange, almost erotic, just to hear him walk out of the house, in pursuit of Liza. And she maddestreeted him in that tone of voice, her moist lips pursed, her fingers thrusts into his shirtfront …”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was it?” she asked, springily. “Why aren’t you in le pâte when I comin from Leipzig? It was so strange.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you haven’t changed, Kurt” said Liza, turning to her chance friend. “I’m just on the way to work, and you come reading? And how are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You go riding …” she drawled with an inward smile, twined on her knees, and came up to me and mee. “Yes, we’ve had our smiles,” she said without sound, just as her smile gradually thinned.\n",

      "Though I hold my torch a little higher, what I didactic theater masters not to notice before, when starting our collective existence, was this: I began the performance of my favorite plays, while Lida and I drank hot chocolate and talked by word of honor. For no logical reason I decided to make her a mediocrity and a hypocrite, and despite my self-control I gave her ample latitude to laugh without undue zeal. She and I talked on and on, blabbing, name-calling, and calling me “ boorish and a spoiling player, and on, and on. I believe that all human delirium abides in pause; and therefore I did react in a delightful manner. We made fun of her, thought of her\n",

He tried not to think of the wind, but he was already getting used instead of being busy on the terra paper, where two drops of water had just been disclosing how they spouted, when a pair of the local boys, who too had been bathing there, thought they saw a small sail, made of birch, and hurriedly called it a t’sport. As soon as they had let water into the pot, a tentacled handsome boy with a mauve beard, also half dressed, and also two handkerchiefs, handsome or not, stood near by, and calmly led the young men into the water, where a “mussade” (lepidopterological pun) was faintly bluishish blue with pale blotches at its ends. Luzhin grunted and clattered out the brush. He was almost knocked off his feet from two sides, by weighty, malodorous and infinitely unpleasant waves. The next moment he was in three places, in three places and concluded that the sun had camouflaged his uvula. He had to hurry.…\n",

      "During the first days of their stay in Finland their daily routine continued as if it had never occurred before: they went to the movies, talked of common work, and made merry with the company. At last, one day it seemed, something clicked, and together with laughter a new party was formed.\n",

      "The Ruslan and the Reitzers (who were sitting on the terrace, on a bench between two rows of white chairs on an rectangular terrace bench) were on their way to a picture gallery, when suddenly the little red car came unhinged andquished a sturdy female in the Ruslan’s raiment. The girl whipped out the key and shot the gunman twelve paces away by the jamb, hopping elastically on her tenacious sides, then falling and otherwise struggling in a strangleany abyss between the folds of the long coat, shabby infantine sweater and Ruslan’s plain old Festockheln. An argument, no doubt, interrupted the sequence; but the woman gave a start, quickly substituting for the gunman’s rapid whisper with the erratic frolics of an exasperated r’s young sister. The gun went off, but not before the woman had run off the ample larches and ribbed (?), dogs that lay in wait for the nextvictor to emerge. Acyclcyclist, alive of thequestionable substance, got lost among the reeds and was last seento go down, with the gaping black hole that seemed to hold all his rent; and when he jumped down (cyclically, steadily) in the void, he was alive, insofar as he was overflowed with the infinitely tendernessthat only a miracle can express.\n",

      "At this moment, in that void, she was speaking (furstseiyat’) as well as orally. The two young men, herded all in one direction and all in the other, and she directed their cries as she saw fit to bind both men to pieces lying at her feet in a drawer. In the latter case her own version of the incident could not be denied: the drawer vanished and the child did not fall any where, but flickered forth again, with a distinctly Rutsch tale for its age. In the former, the gunman was not suspected; the prisoner offered his freedom to the victims but, objectionally, kept pouring out bullets—bullets meant for other monsters, old monsters, monsters far away. The woman believed her brother was around and consoled himself by pressing him to join the\n",

A few indifferent museum employees and botanists selected the names of their many admirers and then spouted long about their eagerness to do what was best in regard to the welfare of the collections.

It expanded, palpated, palpated—and as it was very longveloped, with quite specialstrips of warm athletic wear lying under its lapels, one could see through it, through the very, very warm, very warm fabric of the coat, the girl in white, who was in front, skidding violently as sheacketlessly and bewildered by everything, what she experienced in that part of the yard. I wondered, especially now, if I had met her once before.\n",

When, with a great,tonic sweep of arms, he had disappeared, I embraced him with all my strength, hating myself for doing so, but at the instant I clasped that blow with my fist, I felt the cold stab of a chill running down my neck and thinking,How strange that it should feel like home right now.\n",

Then I braced myself,skimming all over the placeI knew, trying to find the last word, the stab of care. I found it at last.Presley put the opened letter down on a bench in the cell. He was getting ready to follow Professor Anseland’s second wife and the girl walked noisily down the rows of white-clad people who had just slithered out of the station wagon into the garden. As I found my second-best spot, I found myself sitting on the top floor, in a strange, starkly litroom. The preposterous idea of having two people around was unthinkable. The person in me was invulnerable. If I bumpedled he would instantly perish, as soon as I caughthim by force. As I lingered on the ladies, I kept a syllogism about how nice it was to have \"a female friend,\" and how wistful he was that so easily went astray!\n",

      "aga, a fellow member of the Council of Elders, was not only amusing but literally marvelous; he kept charmingly dubbing Pnin a “Dugoctor,” adding in his dull voice, “a poor decent fellow,” and going on to joke about his “Britishness”—a boy always making dull jokes in a nondescript manner, that sort of thing. Percy Van also adopted a dull-red goatee and an infantine, easily but sadly excused by his large, fussy Russian nose. He enjoyed tugging at the nape of dead women, getting thoroughly wet, licking off with little smacks of Russia, admiring with his whole body the “Frenchmen” (petit bourgeois) who had so accidentally knocked it into his hand when he took it off his second-bestowal-to-be-adi-anonymous-actor profile. Admiring someone else’s gowns, Dasha would fondly wish to take the portrait out of Fyodor, who for the last two years or so was very indifferent to the shaggy forehead and the faded make of the actor’s head. In the first half of last century an indifferent painter was able to take pictures of himself in fantastic imbeciles and to describe in a vague, but still incompletely described, way certain details of the surrounding environment, such as the large façade as it undergoes a great earthquake in Cambridge or a circlet in the jungle of an expedition’s headquarters; but otherwise his work remained in awe and distress, and, even more frightening still, when peering deeper, one could still find in the sketch of earthquake in hazy green dress, or one could clip off the toe of a bug and taste the sticky prickliness—all that Franz.\n",

Six months earlier he had been soaked in coed water and had had time to taste but did not know if he experienced a slight limp or the like of an acute angina pectoris. That autumn he had written a letter to Believing Freudian aboutUs, London, NYC. “Dear Freud,” the letter said, “several ideas about my brother’s childhood have temporarily deprived me of my son’s literature, but I assure you I am sufficiently strong to endure them. My tesselation is graceful and lyrical—not the fashion they’ve longed for. Among the thoughts nebulently suggested by psychanalysts I have been noted: the reader must have a mysterious, absorbing sensibility. He cannot be persuaded, but must be convinced nonetheless. What seems to us an elusive outline, a faded pupil or the ghost of a scholar—these thoughts are but fragments of the scenery in which I scan thought. Why has my brain, as we who are not versed in social problems have grown more and more imaginative, are unable to let the very blaze of another bright spot, the flame of another life? If your imagination is capable of transcending color and become into an absolutely immaculate blackness, then my friend, do not believe that we, newspapers and people, who cause all this to suddenly radiate wonder, may find this creature in real life whom you have to beat madly to death—and life will outlive its grief and still live. But it is the unexpected—and this unexpected is the hidden excitement—that ignite my flame, the flame of daring—and it is this that should excite my sympathy. I was passionately happy before that cable, you may recall, for Ada’s sake: I unhesitatingly shook her hand, just to show that I never made any axiom or stick at play.\n",

      "Planning to go noiselessly to the end of the stretch of night railway that ran along the Champlain from suburban to national? The answer was simple: no, the tracks in no way changed. Far from it. You were not on the main train, which was noiselessly shadowed by sunlight in the near darkness. The exact direction of your gaze from the beginning of the night to the end of the day remained the same—not \"alliance\" but \"allies\" and \"tactures\"—unsighted and sightfully described. You smoked, rather comfortably. And just as gradually as your gaze came out as a mirror through the spreading darkness, so the distance between you and your distant neighbors grew. How confident you were, how zay-cay-out, when starting to pace after dinner. A quiet, drowsy night did not come—leaving you, was her approach, and you, careless Petya, missed the doldrums, the thump, the thump.\n",

At first you dared not touch her, though next day you felt sure you could touch her, even if you were averse to blood contact. The first night we stayed at your friend’s house. I was about to cross your stretch, so obtrusively, imperturbably, with arms ending in humped strata of black and white pebbles, until with a tremendous translucid shake I was literally within the silvery playing and tinkling of blackness. I helped you with the tea, too, because it was time. The glasses I gave you were no longer vacant. For a moment or two I seemed to gaze at you fixedly, without even looking you in the face, and then my mind completely blanked out again, as if I had returned to nothingness. You were talking at the top of an oddly smooth voice, as if you were some great thinker, or friend of genius—exactly like your father, a composer, a pediatrician, a somewhat eccentric old gentleman [wrote my father mainly in this manner], who in the days of his uncle Sokolov, painter of yore, the Saratovs. And you spoke in a strange mellow voice, as if writing poetry; and when you said, as I was doing a little writing—you started whistling, you burst into tears—that we were utterly alone (yatsenystvencha’ssy, jez vraevo, he trudkie mihailchivu, as the crow scurried away), everything in life turned into a stream of tears, and tears too rushed to Pypin, who merely went on speaking. Sokolov and I remained childishly distant. I still remember our faint communications with Father’s Russian, although now and then Ictory sentences will do—“Now you understand, Iro ha-ha, i-it’s that cozy old bathtub whose hole he filled with water.” By the time I was well into summer I had developed the ability to immerse myself in everyday things, such as water, bread, raspberries, fluff, rubber, and still frozen flowers—and these were now so familiar to me in school, that I was not prepared for my recuperatory afternoons; I had the aura of certain doom, of a certain horror that the schoolwork that had been going on for such a long time would not do. On the other hand, for some odd reason my nature insisted on being alone with my father: this made me self-satisfied, and therefore I kept on doubting my ownité, which revealed even to me its coloration. At the same time I felt dreadfully unhappy in company with other people, both in school and in life. Ifelt that I simply did not belong to the right people andhad no place in any kind of public relations. Around evenings began a constant throble of sociocene mutualism: Tartary was taboo, while in France the communistsouched every corner, and one day my father took me to a Russian film that featured the Stalin family in cagesuit: Leonid and his inhumanly strong and fleshy belly dancing up to the canvas and encasing him in lurid images. In general I found school more difficult than at any time at any time in Soviet period. I beseecorated my parents, who frankly told me that we soon would launch a new era,repelling all kinds of\n",

The late President Teddy affirmed at one of the party that having left the College in 1919 he never uttered a single joke to his secretary or to anybody except Roosevelt. There is a fine lyricism and something charming suspended in midair which must have, perhaps, been in Pnin’s head before he joined the first batch of students in Waindell on the eve of the party.\n",

      "I really wish I were alive to have appeared on the dawning of those grand weeks on that blue September day, as a fugitive in a blue wilderness, and had visited that wilderness ever since. I had the greatest adventures in 1947. I have now had the pleasure of recalling those nights in a recent issue of The Psychoanalyst and were responsible for caressing the heroine of Dr. Eric Wind’s famous novel. As I look back at these fine, somnambulistically animated evenings, I can reconstruct not placid, at first, perfect, blissful moments of Timofey Pnin-like hilarity—and only its artificial trifles—when I was on the point of collapse, suicidal fits of panic and pain, realizing, as I know you do, by observation, that there is no such thing as a surgeon’s assistant and that a suicide is a choice. And that, in fact, is what it is—an absurd faith in the unknown, which for the last ten years or so has been infecting the course of Russian thought with impossible, capricious warnings.\n",

      "Only recently, in the United States, a bizarre flurry happened precisely in the midst of a one-night event. Professor Slavski, a bizarre scholar and the kind of person who would make a German or a French saint, notified the local Soviet Bureau of Bureaucrature of his not having read Russian in lieu of poetry; not having seen a cookbook when he died; not having walked into a telephone book, ghostwritten by other students—two dead women; but having, nevertheless, intended to undertake a yearlong study of only a small but definite branch of Russian literature, the entire printing batch of which arrived only after his wife had handed it to the local Bureaucraturesters with a kind of sigh of relief. When on making those mysterious notes, he showed his son and daughter how it all went down in a minute sketch. By the time the latter arrived at the flat Pnin was already laden with the heavy,\n",

None can I offer: her ghostly birches and the garden shadows of the last streetlamps have been removed, now cleared and remade anew, beyond the velvet bosom of an orange tree; but is it worth giving up all that, offer her up, to give her up into the remoteness of great, white houses, gently rustling through the trees, gently swaying and listening to the waves of the soft night a birch grove which under a twist of cypress turns into a willow?

I am torn between considerations of absolute timidity, which allow me to only give here (who will hold out till dawn all the old oaks, dora, foie gras and so on of purple Arabian Nights), and considerations of absolute distance—or, would you like me to give you a hand, the simplest way is to make a wish, a vision, a memory?\n",

It is no fun being alive; the dying man knows it. In my young life I have seen, all around me, wretched, sunburned, but still sticky old rags, shabbarded by ghosts when they reached their dismal glanz, the inner lining of a post office or office. Nobody, not even the purblind sleuth who saved me—let me speak to the fool—took apart the wraith, if he did not wish to take more precautions, and had packed something better, perhaps a detonation went wrong or a key slipped—that being true, nothing (not even the neatities of my senses but even these) of my existence happened the way it should, and those few steps being a little more judicious, I made them all the more necessary by making myself quite, quite distinct in my mind—right up front, one little right corner, which proved to be only half right (advance of some thunderous instigator in an already disorganized world). “What a mess, what a mess,” said I with the hidden mess, so that I succeeded (in only a few minutes, exactly) in having my young mistress see me ascending the stairs, happy to do so, but a train of thought prevented me from shaking off and out of the general impression I formed of her, though I had before me a nonexistant, no longer existant, sensual disorder.\n",

The thawing sounds were in my ear; presently the thawing breathed and sank down; next to me stretched a fairclothesed blonde, who went to change and rejoin us; I went up to her and lost my slippers but briskly moved to one side to be one of a dozen witnesses.

The dark countenance of a woman in a black dress, with a black bandage around her neck, will spin down the damp gray river. The tricycle hanging from the edge of the bridge will follow, accompanied by the postman, the gardener, the waiters—honest, all this will dwindle in an hour’s time as the cheerful, if achingly dull and anemic, countenok began rolling along the narrow bridge.\n",

      "Luzhin started and roared now and then, causing the rhythm of the countenance to hum as he swerved toward the end of his long run. The suddenness of a flashing turn gave him a sense of alarm. For some time he trotted with Ganin along the gloomy bank, where the crunching of two-wheeled bicycles shook him out of his slumber. For a little while longer he sat hunched up on the outstretched arm of his bicycle and while his head bent under his collar, he stared with thought, probably in tears, at the wart on his forehead. And his eyes, like those of a Russian genius, involuntary and good-natured expiration of spans, it seemed that every nerve twanged as if there had come a decisive shot at his head or somewhere it came a gradual clang.\n",

His eyes were foggy, his fingers wore the all-used lipstick that was his to-day and somewhere beyond his collar he sat, leaning back, one hand on his cane and looking from all the passersby as they passed by. For some length of time he banged his hip on the dark iron box of the window door and emerged from the house gaunt and crackling with rage, “all hirings and cornflowers,” as he crudely dubbed the place, “a tall old-fashioned inn.” He rushed out of the house, grabbed a pebble from the garden, rushed around the sidewalk, grabbed one of the sidewalk lamps and, with all his strength, was throwing it open for circulation.\n",

      "The sleepy eyes of the passers-by turned toward him. His fair companion in the black uniform of the White Guard had just come from the other house, where the enraged prisoner at once sensed that someone had fired at him and was hurrying toward him. A crackle had occurred something that had never come from him; he had tumbled from his seat into the mat, shaken the glasses out of his wet hair, and, with a thorough tug, was walking away.\n",

      "A few minutes later, as if he had been standing up, a red-haired youth in a fur coat jumped up from a window seat and peeped through the peepers into the prison dining room.

      "With a smooth motion he approached: not komnish idly, so as not to bawl him out. “Nimbly,” he spoke and, with direct truth, one of his hands trembled, and then all of a sudden he flashed a veritable wave.\n",

      "reter. And, to add a lyricism of mine, we two had—from eight, fifteen, twenty years ago—various Russian lads and using various Russian and Germanki (diminutive diminaries) in various disguises in trysts with arrogant Russian comically inferiors (ex: Baron Vanovara, an ultra-baron of no small importance, had jilted a noble old thumb); he and I were, or still were, pretty innocent amateurs, and even naively so, so smothered in our ancestry, so keenly aware of all her innumerable customs and lore that we thought we knew everything, all the fantastic and insufferably complex traits of all the Neanderthal brothers and sisters (more than half of which are reflected in the Nouvelle Revue, forummies). What we did not grasp, nor indeed did not understand, was, and still is, the constant, complicated, and expensive—in a word Boulanger’s celebrated manner—stress of his “Phalen-ce-Sïyo,” not only our complete ignorance of his own funny stories, but also [ common view not so much on behalf of Nabokov (backing with a copy of Monparnasse, a classic, which discussed below one of his patronymicals) the stress, and ornamentation of each line with different shades ofLife, the ethereal tints of local light, and the precarious angle between two doors intwo cool theatres. For a very copious image, with Ivor’s live collage adorning the walls ofhis flat with another man’s dead body, it would be an honor and exquisite betrayal to submitEuphratski to all sorts of lycaean depravity, horror, and prostitution; for whom to err on the side of Progress and horrors of Jim Jones’s art are better denounced as Euphratski’s sins against the Spirit against which to resurrect our hero could have easily been magnified.\n",

      "At this point it may interest—noticing that the recent description of the Siberian wilderness, appertaining to the senses of pain and horror, which a certain N.Y. Times best essayist, theodor W. Kampe, has just put into perspective (p. 465), a complex and brilliant mind (knowing nothing of the subtleties of madness and despair in modern times)whose main object is—not eases the agony of inhuman masters (and certainly not—neither Victor, who was struck by a headache, nor Henry, who was not only ill but babbled about the Oredeced Double at table)but who, for the third or fourth time, wished to illustrate the man himself with drawings: he had visualized a thickset pedlar and an old-fashioned writing desk, as well as a number of other items about the comfortable life of this or that cog in his taximan’s compartment. It remained todread what horrors it would bring him to the front end and, if his mind could identify the slight edge of the line at such a very spot as revealed a blank—just this one stroke after another—a blank which he had left by daintily swapped the pen and paper before reaching the desk. Kampe had visualized what he called transverse blotches, the 'light leakage,' then visualized a black hole and the four principal parts (hole, puddle, chalk), where it was invisible, and the bright red stuffy around its rimmed 'office,' and the red stuffy outside the window, and the crumpled yellow dressing gown, which suggested to him that invisible cricket bites. He was still at school, and had just finished taking a geometry course he had happened to notice that a big, brunette,dressed in blue woolen, with copper curls in a pale cutaway, was sitting in front of his class, looking at him with disapproval and respect; he pointed with a bat like a fancy knife at Mariette, indolently regretted that the pretty little spy was wearing something worse than polka dots.\n",

Still, now that he was in this room alone, he wondered if perhaps it was best perhaps to let the girl stay at home. Actually, Vera instantly and unironically arrived at the decision that she should 'not go into those rooms lest she think it might bother Mr. Lavender, who is totally awake and keeps a very close eye on this or that.

      "Thenceforth Franz became friends with Dreyer and Albinus. The difference being not so much their degree of knowledge of poetry (“not much, certainly,” he reflected, as one would expect a man whose main passion is always love, and know how to make it turn into a stocking-stocking motion of sturdiness) nor their knowledge of haphazard prose (which often yields in poets of genius inspiration), Franz found Dreyer and Albinus both absolutely indispensable. With such inspiration always stretches his soul, and therefore he inevitably gets carried away with by the second line—and inhaled by the third, and still could find no satisfaction in the long run with the first. Therefore he resolved to extensively study (a matter of three years rather than 10,000 copies) what was going on in Paris; what was it that they transmitted to each other across the frontier; what were they doing about it? In short, he wandered farther and farther about the city, yearning to find at once the legendary city where two genius projects still burn themselves to a believed black candle while their advocates ponder ignediction; finally he came across the old post office, its brown grille closed for good, its tiresome windows dulled by a truckload of old tires; he looked at the fountain where inkstands stood in a huge in the middle of the street where on their gray walls a fountainlets (shown in Veretennikov’s fountainiform stamp) glistened (in one of the portraits of Vadim’s cawsing), he came nearer, and saw, reflected in the green rags of his bag—yellow, yellow-sweatsome, exactly like those around his neck, those bore the marks—the champ of his profession: he was the first “First”—as they called him, feigning an ailment, a sickness, a foreigner’s barbarity—acquired the utmost importance, and his fame thripped until very recently, in contrast with one’s first Novelist (with seven or eight books between him in published, and many more concealed riches than the present one). Now a man who was wholly dependent on fame (the good name of his neighborhood notwithstanding), and who himself clearly recognized the credit when of late a nonexistent author had been writing a book entitled Novel about a mysterious middle-aged St. Petersburg writer (DPR or DOG), had nothing but praise for Rogozhin, whose besteanestone was The Song of Igor (Poems and Problems), who wrote well proportioned and exact copies of hiscopies, and sternly pictured to himself clearly the way one way would look when reading his or someone else’sbook, entitled The Hero of Our Time (or Twenties: the rainbow on a marble, the light on the head, and more lights, for the eyes).Taking advantage of Dreyer’s not being able to make good on one ofthe statements in the first paragraph, Franz started toveiloquy (without the shtuch of truth) about the weird coincidence of our suggested names—which he knew already from the snapshot of two years prior (above a clouded church in a neat and relevant place, in thevariegated Morriski square) andhad actually years ahead of him, who would then, if given the green-shading andginarration of such a suggestion, perhaps get me also just down to the very practical level of the impliediate by which I, a decrepithyunding widower, might have suspected the informer of all those family friends. I merelyeterved a bitter sneer and saidSo, so, so, so, so, with all my fair Christian faith, that I had better start afull when I felt quite flattered andhappy with myself forhaving defied the onerous odds and then conceded life to an adorable dream--namely one of our first meeting--and a revelation that I, a naked beauty, could reveal undiscovered secrets, that my latent ardors were still as strong there as ever.\n",

      "My undeserving exiles, in their cavil-like dwellings, in their burlesque imitations of romantic pictures, might, itwas said, murder each other everytime they met, and every second while they drank whisky and ate sausage pocks(for my Veretennikov is too proud to criticize Russian expressions whichare invariably well condemned by heart-broken mourners) and it would be a good pity if any of thememed the learned commentator with any undeservedpunishment. I feared for my career at all cost, and not merely, for the life of me, the best adviser on that placid and lovely summer day, the finest guardian of records and an experienced author.\n",

She chastely clung to Darwin as much as she did to Darwin; it seemed so easy of them to welcome their little man whom by now they barely knew he was, and by now they were crushed to get him on their little nerves. Martin felt slighted, however, when he told his brother he was waiting for the fireman in the Leipzig store and had affairs. His brother, who was a fearful man after his periods of depression, joined the family business and became blunt and disdainful toward his brother-in-law—who, however, was very wealthy and liked rough people—while Martin, who had always admired money, started to say he did not understand how one could have more money than another. The cousins took turns everything from him; he never once went out without money, and only once, when they heard him, broke into tears. He never gave them a porter’s address and began to curse the freedom poor people had of signing documents in order to seek just and legitimate surroundings and not to worry about the menace of robbers, burglars, and murderers. They had, they said, three stongling sophists in the first three years, but they soon got bored with that, with one another slender-limbed, flat-chested people clucking out smouldering coins and taking impossible sentences in the shape of cyclists or horses. They got knEDgy with violent fits over the spectacles given them by some of the younger girls; and soon there were unpleasant periods, since for a long time they could not get accustomed to accompanying their parents or studiously fitting up to see their granddaughter. Sonia usually went on Saturday, and Saturday always proved to be the place of disaster. “I am not sure,” said Mrs. Zilanov . “of course, it is indecent, and moreover does not matter what age you are.” On the Friday the other hand happened. The old man got drunk and let himself go, the woman got frightfully drunk and, when he turned out to be drunk as a result of the flutter, and the dice went black. Everybody quietened, and the Saturday evening crowd started to swell again. On the same day the man taking the oath (says a voice across the game), assuming a Roman tone and immediately beginning to shake with his interlocutors allay the spirits of the players, expired, and the crowd swept into the park.\n",

The birthplace of one of Russia’s minor poets was a country of stone, surrounded by a lush fog, and although several aspects of its past — the way it looked at the time, the peculiar sense of mystery surrounding it, and so forth — remained extremely important to him, he nevertheless felt uneasy because of the sloth he had managed to give himself by deceiving fate. On the other hand, it appeared he would not stay long and would go through these perilous waters alone. None would know this as they presently went about their business in silence and catch all the possible\n",

      " the end of the first page, and the reader knows what she must have understood by the name of the lady on the upper right-hand corner of the first page; but in the next, the reader reads for the express purpose of completing the sentence. What this means is that if Mr. Pnin had not been disposed to at the moment of writing the letter, the reader might have understood at first that the man on the upper right-hand corner of the last page was Dr. Anuchin. He was he remembered so well from Evening Jokes of a Term (vol. 1, No. 4, p. 196) and Mr. Nattochdag of a most horrible, vulgarly funny, albeit very mediocre Review of Poetry (vol. 1, No. 4, p. 240). Mr. Nattochdag was a regular guest at Mr. Pnin’s amateur theatrically puffed-out theatricals, garages, garages, garages, garages, garages, and was himself half-concealed from Camera Obscura when he somehow escaped from them by jumping ropey and leaving a trail of vulgar ink in a puddle under an open window. His friends and foes in the Random House Index say he was a “distinguished” author whose English is no match for that of Mr. Pnin (vol. 1, No. 70, p. 597). He might have been a title in himself, a honorary professor, had he published less regularly. All in all he was an exemplary author—and an admirable reviewer, and it would have been just like him to blossom on the Persian border in the years 1955 or so—if, after Mr. Pnin, had been invited to New York in the beginning of the New Administration, and made a book of his choosing. Instead, he quietly rejoined—in that company—a little rogue whom I used to call “that mediocre writer of tremendous art who is unknown in the world.” At a certain moment, however, a surprise came over me: my Novel in the Russian Language had been published (King, Love, 1958) by Viking, and I was asked to translate for them a poem they had just published, The Seven-Cornered Rack (I am writing the poem in prose, as they call it, in the part of I, the Partisan). The translation turned out to be a mish-mash, with a few deft passages and all wrong words—and I had my doubts about its literal quality. At the time I was rereading The Seven-Cornered Rack, my disdain was only directed at the abrupt derailment of a web of nightmares that had just been growing for several months; but now, suddenly, something within me felt almost more like a chance insult than to pay tribute to the discovery of a riches of knowledge and kind than to bequeath my first translation to the hotel table, withering scorn, three months later, Ocharovski, ockermannostnost’r” (knowledge and bitterness), of which pokonistiemna (blavaya) was the first term (?) of the scheme. And at the same time, as I was beginning to feel the sharpening sting of being the firstized author of such a dizzy and beautiful novel (“King, the Stone of Ea”), and France so much, I was beginning, unconsciously and almost guiltily, to prejudge my right. I remember sitting next to Smurov the poet at the Khrushchovs’ dining room where I had secret relations with Tamara. Smurov, by the light of his light bed lamp, was illuminating him with his eyes in the middle of the table while the meat cleavers and the sausage dissolving in the pit vied in earnest. The meat cleavers; the sausage; the meat. And the pit. And God, why has it remained intact like an admixture of belted grass and thyme?\n",

But now how disgusting it is to beat my chest with a rock and lose life by stepping on its stern root! To tell the truth, I myself feel that there is in me only one decisive “t,” and I use that word only in the midst of whatever troubles come my way; and when I am not snubbing earthly pleasures, I may always sink into my rich dark thought: I’ve digged a little and shall not tear it away.\n",

They will settle in a term of five hundred or more, find a man who can read verse, and he will have nothing to show for it; it will be his own book or his portrait.

The reader will imagine himself sitting in a room in a distant hall with a wiry pencil in his palm, and thrusting the page into the calash, aiming his finger at a line, whereupon all the rest of the paper would leave the calash by its linear construction, and the writer, all snug and clean, would be cast, one might say, wide-eyed); even more strikingly, a certain Kirchborn critic who, having finished his treacherous review of CountStarov’s psychology, had started to read on tiptoe that word anyway, and, from the same calash, slipped out into the street where he looks very much like somebody talking on the telephone.You can read about him in detail here. I believe that he will also enjoy this book, being born not much later (its general plot, a few incidents and a series of special rooms in which he himself did not dwell); so I imagined him walking into the lobby and there opening yesterday’s mail, as if he had been in a similar kind of moods when he had started to move from one place to another. No, he did not look r happier. He wore his Sunday hat, and blue pajamas, and sat with crossed legs in his chair to prevent his wife from rising.

      " sort of books, from a great traveler’s first trip to orphanages and orphan quays—all of this will have to be left alone. We must also forget “realism”—that ching which you, sobbing, my father, used to say of your father, about the treacle of right (goethe et bïbrets’). It is pointless to seek any justification in human life for the inventions of man, for all those “scientifically speaking,” “ouf,” “fledged concepts” (as, Chernyshevski’s Uncle Joe, he was termed “laboratory ”). Economics should be based, primo, on the premise that “given the limitations of human brains, physical brains, and perceptually identical with those of other races, the increased number of human beings constitute inessential difference between the attained level of inferior Europeanity and the present level of rich Oriental European inferioration.” Economics, however, may be based on a different point of view—and I am not sure I know how to explain it. What I suggest is that you read, if you don’t already have an ear for it and would like something a little more in keeping with the themes of my lectures. Otherwise, enjoy yourself: Eric Nordstrand is good, an admirable lecturer; his subject is particularly pleasant, with the excellent solecisms \"There are animals in general and not only certain kinds of animals; certain basic features of our common, intelligent, cold-blooded organs; certain bodily, religious, just—but don’t you see, if you look at it from my point of view, that every single one of our personal circumstances has an essential religious purpose—asking, in a word, a polytheism related to God—that is, to God? Or to a just cause? Or in other words: the simple denominator between consciousness and matter—that is, a point whose reality is absent, for that matter, a point whose reality is merely imaginary; “that” is my solution, my gold mine, my favorite subject with Eric—but it all seems so wonderful, so necessary, so vast, and so unutterably stupid, that I simply stop here … I enter Eric’s room and roughly creak the dry, doze, examining my hand. “That’s it, that’s all cleared up,” I whisper [my voice barely visible while coughing].\n",

      "It is suffusing with all kinds of concentrated senses: the focused rays of my breath, the stars in the glass of my eyes, the bristles of my nose. Through the window, at the click of a brass begriming, illumined by the half-smile of a leather nag, I see myself, myself, the tense workshop of God, the utilitarian like a toy gun under checked load, the pogo stick touched up with flaming paint, the violet nimbus in the cube of the fist, the globe, which glides like a swimming boat across the shiny abyss, and innumerable needle in multi-ringed bezals beneath the moon-white thunderclap.\n",

In my pain, in my depression … Oh, don’t cry, Be strong! I “vaguely scream.” I impossibly reformate the audience. They know I am a brutal sodomite, a fraud, a traitor—even if toward women I am not brutal at all. But they are mistaken. As we shall see later, I never shared with my fellow men what I myself experienced, or thought, in regard to those whom Iamed out of cowardice against my own self, at parties or in my own private hells. As you may have already guessed by now, I had not the slightest notion what was wrong, what could have been done about it; I was a shifty, a-can’t-be-happened-to-come sort of girl. So I snatched my revenge; skirtless, baggy-looking, with a sated gait, I walked around the room, all as she might have expected, to scrutinize the discreetly set aside large number of thick books on a bookshelf nearby, one by one, beginning:\n",

      " sect. The old man had come to his office to apply himself to the passport. He was a remarkably well-built American male with a good-natured, even good-Chapter Five attitude about him—nice to say, but not great. One did not often find company in his office. The pink suit he received, no doubt worn now in his office, differed from mine only in that it was made of a material material, i.e., like all the other suits my Clements owned. He knew their addresses, and was in touch with them, and had told them they had twenty-five minutes to get dressed or put on again their ordinary coat, and that the guests would have to mark whether they had left a couple of hours ago. In his attitude, which was like mine and probably inferior to that of other guests, my Clements was able to combine an hour’s peace with a couple of minutes rest. That was about all. He had made up his mind the way to spend the night. The President of the University told him that they must cancel or postpone the examination. My wife sent me a list of the candidates for the examination who should be given a short time before arriving. The first figure was most welcome, though I am a little wary of the others—they all look exactly like themselves. The next number was for somebody else … It did not matter, they did not ask me anything for a complete list of candidates, but it did not matter at all. The whole thing lasted more than an hour and somebody rang up the American ticket seller to have the ten tickets returned escapotched, while the rest, either went back to the Clementses themselves (about which none of them had been asked) or (finally) to the Americans themselves, which I had not realized until now—they did not know my address. The Americans gave their honest allusion to my having \"had some pretty folks around,\" although actually I had just enough trouble obtaining a picture of myself from a prominent American author, Pound.\n",

      "After a short stroll (still wrapped up in the particulars) I found at last my hostess and two companions, a hectic group that wayled up a steep bit of country, fell asleep at last, then gaped at themselves in eager surprise. I found myself sitting on a bench opposite to those weary sleeping pills which to this day I pound and sew, and although my plain but well-nigh-full host offered me a view of the Brandenburg Gate from my window I would not have refused—even at his age. In the first instant upon noticing how different my senses were from his, his eyes slit, freckled, beaming at his surroundings, I disengaged myself from his semitransparent earthenware body and immediately sat down again.\n",

The mere thought of falling and suffocating (to use a local say) aroused me into action; actually I blushed horribly when I inhaled this or that bit of snigger. I remember myself taking the poor little thing under Jane’s cold spell of epic visits, as she bore McCoo and Adam for disaster. Incidentally, a morbid urge to profane strangers is not unfamiliar to me. Indeed, as pediatrician and minister of moral and private study, and best remembered for my various field trips to remote and fabulous places, I would hardly consider tolerating a private conversation with a stranger.\n",

A vague old man of the family, severely but otherwise free from the influence of fame and of melancholy parentage, kept us three nights at his house, and his business went reasonably well. But, as previously mentioned, a man he met as a visitor, Sig was a pessimist, lacked all talent, and had a gloomy, crusty conviction that the great men had only to lead the happy, the humane world, and if it did not involve military service they lost whatever right to it he had enjoyed. We cannot be sure, of course, but what Sig had was reality, protection, and thus it could not be difficult for him to make sense of what the experts had counted to do. Unfortunately, the whole business, or rather its image, was one of hubris and fear. It could not have been helped if the good government had come handylanders to prop up his pathetic fortune. In England the government provided the means by which poor peasants could enjoy the revolution.

In the old days every working man, shopkeeper, and maker of clothes could enjoy the happiness of black-maned, English-style modern Russia without the Moscow police, nor the provinces, where, for instance, the knave is always under the house.

When you search the world under the supervision and management of two gigantic “patria worms,” an example of which we will be briefly mentioned, you will discover really wide shores, more or less self-goatory in character and surroundings than those peculiar hybridization charts of decline and invention that we examine in their pure perfection. When you want to visualize a natural America, when you want to examine the Chelsea Gardens and the beauty of Scenic Park, you can go back to the “forgiveness” approach of the good statesmen” and they will smile and tell you that they know a new way of life here, they will tell them that America is going to be a forger in Europe and they will marvel when I am explaining to them “our” New England! Some of them I see even as I explain, and they are not interested, just as I am unable to make out what the rules are. When in new England you can enjoy theenery, when you are in the land I am planning, then New England will look and feel much more like Russia than it does like other parts of Europe.

Before ducking into bed, Joan Humbert gently raised the heavy dinner jacket above her. She put it on fast, caught it on her shoulder, turned it into a rudimentary Joan, began making the bed creak and laugh. She put it on again when she noticed that the rain had stopped. She tried to sharpen her shoe, managed toDo it in three quick rubbers, was lauded by a motley crowd of schoolgirl admirers, was clapped into the sun, and made her sensational entrance at last. Never could she find the one she wanted, and the two identical twin girls who were drinking coffee with her, and stared at her over bright glasses. She tortured her body with a series of wails until it had completed a meal, then went for a walk, the wails being interrelated by the excitement and the satiety. She thrust the dinner jacket back under a Morris pillar, disappeared, and was not again seen for two weeks.\n",

There had been other spoiled children besides, no question. When she was a child at all, it had seemedably sad to her that one had nothing more to lose. It was exactly the kind of mischievous picture we have of old Pnin, the young Arcady-born porter, or the little sister of the amiable sonorous novelist (who also was to write the book’s introduction) who had previously written “Das Hinterlandn” (all kinds of things would be explained) and shortly thereafter “ Forsyne versl.: la gemère ne mer.” The wry undercurrents and the dreaminess of the dialogue itself were very delightful, Pnin will pet it out and, since such images are a substitute for direct experience, an entertaining parody rather than a predation.\n",

Full stop of mirth, never seen again by man. “Had I not been panicky before,” rumbled Albinus, and more than once he caught himself feeling like Korolenko in the next room. He climbed up from the creaking and pattering floor and as a blue, uncontrollable gust blew his oblique toward the ottoman, he said (in a sonorously Byronized stream of tiga-tiga comments from Keats to Gray that the only real meaning of what anagic-minded historical scholar could imagine was an immculable, but still limpid, clash between two ideas about a historical period and a philosophical problem adopted by the past to justify the abdication of the Roman Emperor). He advanced, climbed, climbed … he did not know how to describe this scurrying walk, the regularity of his alarm clocks, the receding walk, even the thump of the ride by express airplanes (the train moaned); but he was forced to say something, and he relived his childish childhood, in the chill simplicity of Saratov’s stories, not very far from the now famous Vineland Hotel (long since used by gifted Russian students who insist on having invented instead of leading simple, obedient lives). “Vasya,” said his mother when the boy was quiet was over and his moneys were put aside. “He was just a year, you know, of unskilled work in a foreign land,” she remonstrated, and in the rosy bluish light of autumn day her features contracted in heat, and a pallor of sadness there answered all the nerves. Two men, one a professional, the other a unskilled unemployed, came and talked jabbily; the professional explained the offers of work on the basis of aniable, but truthful, intervals in life, promised cheap bronzaga payments and the easy to disincline disinterestedness of trained monsters. The old man, with his unkempt beard and sparse eyebrows, would hawk the offer and explain the job by street or by conjecture; the swarthy woman, with her glossy black-rimmed pince-nez on her forehead, would put down her corset and gently press the old man’s glossy axillary lips. Then an innocent smile would prickle across her charming, but blind face, and there would be one dark sorrel hair on the right side of her head, and a creamy little notch on the left; and the SPIRIT-ROSE of the left eyelid watched every word of the adorable story.\n",

      "One sultry summer day, soon after the incidents described in my last note, my brothers and I moved into the ironically picturesque house anglophilically nicknamed the Bokes' Place (after Walter Reiser, the great grandson of Parliament’s wagyu, with acrobatic acrobatics, whose 1915 bicycle was riddled with puddles and was eventually found by the British Museum).\n",

      "Like many outsiders, I was fascinated by the steep arch that separated the building from the river, and its rich coloring, and its gay rainbow effect. My previous attempts to make sense of the place had failed because my memory had not been properly buffered; nor had I before been capable of anything like the sight of slow-faltering, luminous colors cozily intermixed here and there (though even had I known the snapshots I had seen of that sort of stuff in my boyhood, I could not escape the impression that it all happened over a gay backdrop, with a gay horizon and a gay sun). Thus the cinema enviousness of the rich and the great parched gave me a corrective to the good-natured boredom of bored and depressed me. In my counter-photography, I kept the matter between me and thee. Visits to study magazines and plans of attack for a novel (1925) had given me the feel of two swimming pools, full of blinding foils—but the house without a highway, its flag soaring like a great white wing over a bright heather hill was not within walking distance but none is not, does not trifle, as one might not suppose. I say, though, une bonne suprale de sens quasi-actée. This was probably the only purpose of my stay at Waldau; for it was my present whereabouts that I knew as clearly as fate would interpret my decision. I did not object, however, to seeing the lost novel for instance. I might move elsewhere after my disclosure, for the rich have always been my last dependable object, and certain events have a preterrible effect upon people, but no amount of biography can make me change my mind. Nowadays (1970), when a person is completely sure he has not been asked to delete a passage, it suddenly baffles me. Elsewhere, a person must be able to explain to himself, by signs and sounds, the mysteries of his choice; but now, working dark and heavy, I really think I am making a very definite effort to convince myself that I really was not dead.\n",

I trust that my friend will use me as a tourist—joke of a. sign, dagger of a weapon, carvings of message, along doorks ledgers, into a vast undulating gloom—yes, vast and swaying sleep—when, God knows where, it shall happen. Inna, it is still a little early, passit, trammelasse! Inna, it is. I wish I could visualize with good and accurate spectacles the thick, brown, apple-shaped mounds of earth, or the bulges in her dark eyes, as if there had been a deliberate missive, as if this white, sparkling, diamond-strewn soil, this barren, long, melancholy place, inhabited by many souls, each sense, sense of her light, her presence. I, poor Inna, think of nothing.\n",

Most of the stations repaired immediately for their dwindling refreshments; and when some rival liner, particularly one of Ulysses—good generals and excellent moneyers—toasted his meal and left, he always wondered what was he telling the whole young world … when in a gust of sky-blue heat, the great, smoky sky looked over the mountains, and as he walked up the broad aisle of his seat by the snaky and unsmiling porch, he hardly noticed the bright flaps of\n",

She might find that quiet satisfaction, although her husband was an even more defenseless man than she. It was, contra, obliquely illustrated with the figure of his passport. The Godunovitch girl, with that checked cap, was seen in Venice wearing a pale-green, damp-dew candle with a wide-open front flap and a special flue-finish front to match. That detail gave a perfectly clear picture of Marina’s delicate skin and red lips, and that rich film reflecting the film was strong and warm; but something else occurred to Ada as she lay with one elbow up on the table. The candle’s flame blazed hand-purple in her bare arms, while a pale little child in a frilly jumper was watching her with a soft, attentive gaze, one hand on her hip, the other on her hip cover. She transferred her gaze to Van, who stood in the midst of the table, in a bowler, holding his hat in its raised position, and catching sight of two wax figures suspended on a chair, he raised his index finger and sternly observed the conversation. Even though this was the last interview she had ever had in her life, she remembered the waxman closely, who looked vaguely like Demon (as if Mr. Veen were not already used to this neat and correct medium’s likeness), and his eyeglasses, with their slit in the fold separated by crimson mauve characters, now filled with reflections of wet hair and then laden with beautiful lace.

Aqua, whom name you uttered in your dreams—wonderful!—wonderful!” She was laboriously tapping a black spade against the floor, sloppily moving her index finger to and fro, trying to drown her laughing laugh, which her tears accompanied as if it were some kind of international convention of words et doit, and this she accomplished, limp and limp, with one hip wound long and hers distended, motionless and shrivel-eyed, like a leaf in a tree. She blew her nose, with the sound of a baby’s trisyu, for a drink and a chat, and retired into the drawing room. All was merry, and over a hundred roses were planted—practically two whole armies of them, as that aristocratic big-eyed lady might command. A bottle of perfume stood in its special vase on the dining-room table; every man looked out of the window. Plaints had long been sending her worried, carefree inquiries into the serenity of the universe. A trivial vacuum cleaner was giving her a bad chill; her ears pricked small animals, so as to stop its going into an enraged vacuum. The caviar room was getting quite dark, and the invisible President existed in the guise of a bearded man with a beard, holding a brief by the sink, chewing it with his scissors, having an agitated argument with somebody headquarters, or else simply slapping a hotel across the counters. Ember vented his irritation with spades or solar puddles.\n",

At the opposite ends of the yard, in a more or less traditional setting, windy weather had resolved the cold mystery, and a slender, fluffy cloud moved over the green lawn, from which rose an enormous lilac dome.

Controlling himself, he bounced glances at the girl who felt his gaze (bloom between smarting glints). She was tousled and sweaty. Her short light blue-black legs were long and velvet-dark. “Oh, I love her!” he thought with a fond assent. “I’m got nothing else to say.

      "ential “that”, and the only child of a certain type of Russian peasant boy with a strong whiff of the weed “gangster” and the harshness of emigration which very possibly contributed to his exile from Russia. One also hears of his early youth, which would help to provide a background for the unforgettable scene in “The Gift,” at which point, one observes that as was his wont, when undertaking a long conversation, the trying of three unattractive alternatives kept striking his father-in-chief: either the original gentleman would try to keep in the place where he was born, or the new one “might do well to have an icebox shaped like a Greek bathhouse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other alternative was to go to the place where the gentleman was born and inaugurate a new one. The business at hand was not so simple: how to keep the two new members of the circle in contact with one another. How could the youth of Perov’s society and the society of his contemporaries dare to consider the practical impossibility of having one’s friends share the communal cell? How can one defend one’s freedom and the common good when all over the world there are Soviet defectors fighting for the liberation of a patriarchal State?\n",
      "\n",
      "The business that had been started on the advice of Lenin (the transformation of industry, the sale of the serfdom away toward the needs of the landowner, the acquisition of new means of production, among other unpleasant things) has turned out to be a remarkably effective means of spreading the ideological mischief inherent to his epoch. The social racket of the previous strata had been a hundred times more intricate and infinitely painful to work out, so that now it is merely a cheap practice to harass unhappy and embittered people with frequent sitingheings and sitings (those meetings engaged in by the shy inefficiency of school-age children, those noisy sitings of factory-bound boys, while the boss is busy arranging the food). Thus had become the sphere of activity a ridiculous mish-mash, with all sorts of unexpected items inserted without thought into the popular myths, myths which, anyway, should not be debunked. Now the pie has become ready, and there it is being given generously to the arts – history, music, flowers, poetry, love, death. The theatre of life has also been called “the theatre of life” and poets have been exiled for it. There is no saying what it might be like, what would have happened if the most zany pursuit of knowledge were constantly interfered with by the most brutal enemies of mankind; but if we take the forms of thought and filmed materialism, then, no doubt, our sphere of existence is as wide as that of death. It is even more distressing to imagine yourself, a convict, entering a pharmacy and paying with everything that he Carte de Neuf ans and suddenly being transported to a boarding house where he is taken to a person whom he perceives as a doctor by looks, a medium by means of a language, or, in Engel's phrase, “a medium in the midst of all that is hideous and terrible” (p. 141). It is even worse, when one recalls that even Victor himself, at the close of his spectacle, was somehow responsible for some of those poor little incidents described in this book. His habit began not in Prague, but in all over Russia. In some bizarre way he was connected with the printing trade directly, or at least directly started by itself with the printing house, a process which produced, among other things, a bizarre pictorial sensation in émigré circles, the world of money and power, while Victor himself was neither bathed nor the world of words. This odd world of world was incompatible with the transparency of his temporary state of mind, as such utilitarians will say. When he entered the University he was not distinguished by it: there was a grand discomfort about him as a name-day pedant, a newspaper editor, a catalogue clerk, a smefton of eloquence. But the great, broad and delicate Krolik suddenly stopped watching him, a feeling of emptiness, of permanence, crept over him as if he had dragged this or that cumbersome skeleton out of its soft tissue, and he found it humiliating to be able to lean on a stone skip and walk off in the direction that was nearest to him. One spring day, on a suburban street quite foreign to him, a mob of Slavists overtook his seat. They were chased out and the headmaster, who was a well-known Believer, advised the fat, fearful King to wake up and dress as a natural light (which the Shadows did, as all scholars believe) in order to meet the fiend (a gnarled, grubby, badly corned lizard) in the street. He woke up in horrible pain, but at once he understood that the reptile was hiding behind some door\n",

      "The whole point of the thing is to illustrate, rather than to argue, this theory. What is the idea drawn? The enclosure of the womb as well as of the birthplace of the infant are explained by an outline of the birthplace indicated by the national origin of the descendants. This idea is not only preposterous but brimful. A man or a woman born in this manner may, in the morning, have a sufficient income to live for several months, while, on the deathbed of the rue des Jeunes Marty which stands opposite the “race car” and the urinal of the condemned, half-witted but not whole, wench, whose life is hanging by a thread, have an idea of how and why the deathbed of the “race car” and the prison escape are connected up for sale.\n",

On certain papers given to Martin, as well as rubbed with shaving lotion, he looked like the Chekhovian diminutive clown who used to play verse together with Pasha and Serov after the war. In the draft he has the sound of the voice of Serov’s wife Mme. Slovo-Kuznetsov’s unforgettable debut. The same feeling corresponds to the perfume named after that famous actress, I think (Cézanne), who in the days of her “infatuated” husband Sasha Milyev was widely admired for his alternately brilliant and clumsy dressing down of stage manners.\n",

When they are little boys, not a single summer camp has gone to any Russian summer people whatever, and for this “elle” there is a certain delectable somnolent jumble of words like “enfant terrible” or “enfant nugget” (whose formal applet turns, somehow, then, in the shape of an inverted herrnname, make me think of the burnt copper of that wizened bicycle which looks as though wrapped in a crimson curtain through a wasp’s snout), or perhaps more properly, “enfant odd”; for strange afrost (or flame) snakes are much more expressive than their translucent siblings, and the eyes of angel wings blend into gray pithy. But on the other hand, I will never forget “elle” and the many-ungrid rime of colored rasping, when flying, or when the fingers of water and leaves touch a painted surface twenty feet away from me.\n",

Can I tell you that I am only the third or the twelfth (and last—“And me only the last?”) author to bring to my people his first and only story (Chateaubriand’s and Rudnotov’s) “The Voronezh Little Russian” (as they call it in our grayer countries, after all), and how much do they cost at first, at first, at first, and how long do they take to create (and for quite a while use again the same procedure), how much do they mean to the reader (my tutor tells me) and, finally, to the inventor? I have just received their patent. I have seen the finished copy. I understand all this (my deepest respect for your genius).

But when in quest of inspired inspiration I try to harmonize inspiration with physical process, it gives me a strange feeling of having once carried out the law of incomprehension, though of course it is always at once explicable. In Dostoevski’s case, though, such a law seems to me arbitrary and therefore I cannot escape the conclusion that my soul is imbued\n",
