em all.

DESDEMONA
Alas, he is betrayed, and I undone.	[She weeps.]

OTHELLO
Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?

DESDEMONA
O banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

OTHELLO  Down, strumpet!

DESDEMONA
Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight.

OTHELLO  Nay, if you strive--

DESDEMONA
But half an hour!

OTHELLO  Being done, there is no pause.

DESDEMONA
But while I say one prayer!

OTHELLO  It is too late.
[He smothers her.]

EMILIA, [within]
My lord, my lord
