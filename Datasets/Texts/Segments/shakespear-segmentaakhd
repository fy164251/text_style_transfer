ey you.
Alas, the seas hath cast me on the rocks,
Washed me from shore to shore, and left my breath
Nothing to think on but ensuing death.
Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;
And, having thrown him from your wat'ry grave,
Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.

SECOND FISHERMAN  Ha, come and bring away the nets!

FIRST FISHERMAN  What, Patchbreech, I say!
