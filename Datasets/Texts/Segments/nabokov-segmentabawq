ed. I also never thought that there would be high deductions for old age insurance etc., as proved to be customary at Cornell. In result of various deductions my actual salary amounts to about $4170 for the year.

I have not done any writing at all since the beginning of the academic year as I had to reorganize completely my courses.

In result of all this, I am in a bad financial fix. Do you think something could be done about it soon?

Sincerely yours,
