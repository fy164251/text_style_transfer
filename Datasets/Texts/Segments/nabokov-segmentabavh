attached I am to the College. It is quite a wrench to leave it. However, certain very attractive aspects of the work I am offered at Cornell, together with the security of the position, lead me to accept their offer.

It is with the utmost reluctance that I now submit my formal resignation beginning with the ist of September 1948.

Very sincerely yours.
