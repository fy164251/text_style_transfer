[aside]
Ay, but I fear me with a hollow heart.--
See here, my friends and loving countrymen,
This token serveth for a flag of truce
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers,
So help me God, as I dissemble not.

O, loving uncle--kind Duke of Gloucester--
How joyful am I made by this contract.
[To the Servingmen.] Away, my masters, trouble us
no more,
But join in friendship as your lords have done.
