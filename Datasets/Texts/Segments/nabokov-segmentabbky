Mr. Copinsay, who is of Orkney descent, has some dreadful troubles of his own, and his long journey (through all the drains1 the book) is full of nightmare difficulties (he gets entangled in a West-Indian cruise at one point).

I am writing this in a hurry, have to correct exams. But I want to add that I am delighted with PNIN's progress.
