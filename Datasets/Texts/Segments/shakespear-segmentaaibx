l make it on thy heart,
Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
Than I have here proclaimed thee.

REGAN  Sick, O, sick!

GONERIL, [aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.

EDMUND
There's my exchange.	[He throws down a glove.]
What in the world he is
That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.
Call by the trumpet. He that dares approach,
On him, on you, who not, I will maintain
My truth and honor firmly.

A herald, ho!

EDMUND  A herald, ho, a herald!
