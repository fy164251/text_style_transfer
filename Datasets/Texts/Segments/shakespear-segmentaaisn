 spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honor.

MARIANA, [kneeling, to Duke]  Noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from
breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in 's garden house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees,
Or else forever be confixed here
A marble monumen
