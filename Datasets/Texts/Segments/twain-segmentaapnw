th,
     This haunting nameless pain:
     A tale of the bygone ages
     Keeps brooding through my brain:


     The faint air cools in the glooming,
     And peaceful flows the Rhine,
     The thirsty summits are drinking
     The sunset's flooding wine;


     The loveliest maiden is sitting
     High-throned in yon blue air,
     Her golden jewels are shining,
     She combs her golden hair;


     She combs with a comb that is golden,
     And sings a weird refrain
