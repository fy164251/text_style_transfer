TINO  What's the unkindest tide?

LANCE  Why, he that's tied here, Crab my dog.

PANTINO  Tut, man. I mean thou 'lt lose the flood and, in
losing the flood, lose thy voyage and, in losing thy
voyage, lose thy master and, in losing thy master,
lose thy service and, in losing thy service--[Lance
covers Pantino's mouth.] Why dost thou stop my
mouth?

LANCE  For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.

PANTINO  Where should I lose my tongue?

LANCE  In thy tale.

PANTINO  In thy tail!
