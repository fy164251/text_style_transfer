uld thou wouldst burst!

TIMON  Away, thou tedious rogue!
I am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee.
[Timon throws a stone at Apemantus.]

APEMANTUS  Beast!

TIMON  Slave!

APEMANTUS  Toad!

TIMON  Rogue, rogue, rogue!
I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
But even the mere necessities upon 't.
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave.
Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
Thy gravestone daily. Make thine epitaph,
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
