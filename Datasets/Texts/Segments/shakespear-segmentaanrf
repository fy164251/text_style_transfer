m hiss and kill
Our market. 'Tis in vain, I see, to stay you.
Have at the worst can come, then! Now what say
you?
And yet mistake me not: I am not bold.
We have no such cause. If the tale we have told--
For 'tis no other--any way content you--
For to that honest purpose it was meant you--
We have our end; and you shall have ere long,
I dare say, many a better, to prolong
Your old loves to us. We, and all our might,
Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.
