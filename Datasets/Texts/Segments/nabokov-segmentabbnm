ered letter from Girodias in which he says: "I inform you that we are proceeding with the printing of a special edition of 'Lolita' for sale in the United States since it seems improbable that we will arrive at an agreement for a reprint by another publisher."

I know, however, from my agent that he has received an offer from yet another American publisher so that I am inclined to deem his letter a mere threat. Nevertheless all this worries me extremely. I am no businessman.

I thank you for you
