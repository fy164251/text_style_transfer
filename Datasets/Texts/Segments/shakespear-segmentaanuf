are honorable,
But yet they could have wished--they know not--
Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity.

After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
They froze me into silence.

Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary.
Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows
