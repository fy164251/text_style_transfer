ousand tongues,
And every tongue more moving than your own,
Bewitching like the wanton mermaids' songs,
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;
  For know my heart stands armed in mine ear
  And will not let a false sound enter there,

"Lest the deceiving harmony should run
Into the quiet closure of my breast,
And then my little heart were quite undone,
In his bed-chamber to be barred of rest.
  No, lady, no, my heart longs not to groan
  But soundly sleeps while now it sleeps
