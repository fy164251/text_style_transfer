to torture me in vain.

[Enter a Beadle with whips.]


GLOUCESTER  Well, sir, we must have you find your
legs.--Sirrah beadle, whip him till he leap over
that same stool.

BEADLE  I will, my lord.--Come on, sirrah, off with
your doublet quickly.

SIMPCOX  Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to
stand.
[After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps
over the stool and runs away; and they follow
and cry "A miracle!"]

KING HENRY
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
