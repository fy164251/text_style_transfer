erization or plot. I may do another book on Pnin later on but it would have to be set in entirely new surroundings.

Should the length prove a major consideration, and should you want the agreement cancelled and your money returned, I would accept your decision, of course.

I would like to hear soon from you.

With best wishes,





Sincerely,





PS. The New Yorker has bought Chapter 4; Ch. 5 was too functional for them, and I don't know yet their reaction to Chapters 6 and 7.
