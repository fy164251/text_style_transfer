diversion about Swiss scenery, to keep her from launching into topics
that might betray that I did not know her, but it was of no use, she

away--do you remember it?”

“Oh, DON'T I!” said I--but I didn't. I wished the sea had washed the
rudder and the smoke-stack and the captain away--then I could have
located this questioner.
