ongst the rest was I ordained.

KING HENRY
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
O God, forgive my sins, and pardon thee.	[Dies.]

RICHARD
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death.
O, may such purple tears be always shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house.
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee thither--
[Stabs him again.]
