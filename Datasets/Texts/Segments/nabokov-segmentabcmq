Sir,

Mr. Nabokov asks me to convey to you the following message:

"I have never read anything by Mr. Gerhardie,1 I never heard of him until Lady Snow once mentioned his name to me at a cocktailparty in the late fifties, and I cannot understand whom it may benefit to spread the utter nonsense of his having had any 'influence' on me."





Yours truly,

Jacqueline Callier

Secretary to Mr. Nabokov
