prayers do
pierce,
Pity may move thee "pardon" to rehearse.

KING HENRY
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS  I do not sue to stand.
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.

KING HENRY
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.

DUCHESS
O, happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear. Speak it again.
Twice saying "pardon" doth not pardon twain,
But makes one pardon strong.

KING HENRY  I pardon him with all my heart.

DUCHESS  A god on Earth thou art.
[They all stand.]
