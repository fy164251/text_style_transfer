 Pistol and you friends

NYM  For my part, I care not. I say little, but when time
shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as
it may. I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out
mine iron. It is a simple one, but what though? It
will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another
man's sword will, and there's an end.

BARDOLPH  I will bestow a breakfast to make you
friends, and we'll be all three sworn brothers to
France. Let 't be so, good Corporal Nym.
