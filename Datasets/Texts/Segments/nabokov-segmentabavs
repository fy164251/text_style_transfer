lieve that he is not only a gifted, but also an honest and decent lad, and one who deserves the chance that I wish to give him. I am convinced that, given the opportunity, he will develop into a good, and possibly a valuable, citizen who will serve his adopted fatherland to the best of his strength and ability.

Upon arrival to this country he will reside at the Reed Farm of the Tolstoy Foundation.

I hope that you will find it possible to approve my nephew's application for an American visa.
