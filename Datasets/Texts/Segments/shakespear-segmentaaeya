LUCE
What a coil is there, Dromio! Who are those at the
gate?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Let my master in, Luce.

LUCE  Faith, no, he comes too late,
And so tell your master.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS  O Lord, I must laugh.
Have at you with a proverb: shall I set in my staff?

LUCE
Have at you with another: that's--When, can you
tell?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, [within]
If thy name be called "Luce," Luce, thou hast
answered him well.
