 Ephesus with a rope's end.]

Here comes my man. I think he brings the
money.
How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS, [handing over the rope's end]
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS  But where's the money?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
