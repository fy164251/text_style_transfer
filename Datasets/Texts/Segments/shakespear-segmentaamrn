
PROTEUS
Not so, sweet lady, but too mean a servant
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.

VALENTINE
Leave off discourse of disability.
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.

PROTEUS
My duty will I boast of, nothing else.

SYLVIA
And duty never yet did want his meed.
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.

PROTEUS
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.

SYLVIA  That you are welcome?

PROTEUS  That you are worthless.
