 be ta'en too
Or bring him off. Fate, hear me what I say!
I reck not though I end my life today.

[Enter one in Greek armor.]


HECTOR
Stand, stand, thou Greek! Thou art a goodly mark.
No? Wilt thou not? I like thy armor well.
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
But I'll be master of it.	[The Greek exits.]
Wilt thou not, beast, abide?
Why then, fly on. I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
[He exits.]
