FALSTAFF  No, I think thou art not. I think thou art quit
for that. Marry, there is another indictment upon
thee for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house
contrary to the law, for the which I think thou wilt

HOSTESS  All vitlars do so. What's a joint of mutton or
two in a whole Lent?

PRINCE, [to Doll]  You, gentlewoman.

DOLL  What says your Grace?

FALSTAFF  His grace says that which his flesh rebels
against.
