eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wrack; and, but he's something stained
With grief--that's beauty's canker--thou might'st
call him
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.

MIRANDA  I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO, [aside]  It goes on, I see,
As my soul prompts it. [To Ariel.] Spirit, fine spirit,
I'll free thee
Within two days for this.
