e I know not,
Took some displeasure at him--at least he judged so;
And doubting lest he had erred or sinned,
To show his sorrow, he'd correct himself;
So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
With whom each minute threatens life or death.

THALIARD, [aside]  Well, I perceive I shall not be hanged
now, although I would; but since he's gone, the
King's ears it must please. He 'scaped the land to
perish at the sea. I'll present myself.--Peace to the
lords of Tyre!
