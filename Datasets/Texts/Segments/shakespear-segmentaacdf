[Enter, upon the walls, Somerville

WARWICK
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?

SOMERVILLE
At Southam I did leave him with his forces
And do expect him here some two hours hence.
[Drum offstage.]

WARWICK
Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.

SOMERVILLE
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.
The drum your Honor hears marcheth from Warwick.
