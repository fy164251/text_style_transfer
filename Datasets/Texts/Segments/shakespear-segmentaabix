ve promised: to show your Highness
A spirit raised from depth of underground
That shall make answer to such questions
As by your Grace shall be propounded him.

DUCHESS
It is enough. I'll think upon the questions.
When from Saint Albans we do make return,
We'll see these things effected to the full.
Here, Hume, take this reward.
[She gives him money.]
Make merry, man,
With thy confederates in this weighty cause.
[Duchess exits.]

HUME
Hume must make merry with the Duchess' gold.
