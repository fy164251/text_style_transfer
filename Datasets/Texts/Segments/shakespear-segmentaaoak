ell of virtue and nobility,
How many sons hast thou of mine in store
That thou wilt never render to me more?

LUCIUS
Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
That we may hew his limbs and on a pile,
Ad manes fratrum, sacrifice his flesh
Before this earthy prison of their bones,
That so the shadows be not unappeased,
Nor we disturbed with prodigies on Earth.

TITUS
I give him you, the noblest that survives,
The eldest son of this distressed queen.

TAMORA
Stay, Roman brethren!
