The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
But stayed and made the western welkin blush,
When English measured backward their own

In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
When with a volley of our needless shot,
After such bloody toil, we bid good night
And wound our tott'ring colors clearly up,
Last in the field and almost lords of it.
