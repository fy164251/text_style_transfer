GENTLEMAN
An 't please your Grace, the two great cardinals
Wait in the presence.

QUEEN KATHERINE  Would they speak with me?

GENTLEMAN
They willed me say so, madam.

QUEEN KATHERINE  Pray their Graces
To come near.	[Gentleman exits.]
What can be their business
With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favor?
I do not like their coming, now I think on 't.
They should be good men, their affairs as righteous.
But all hoods make not monks.
