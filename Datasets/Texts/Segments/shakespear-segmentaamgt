 he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth send for her
Shall win the wager which we will propose.

HORTENSIO
Content, what's the wager?

LUCENTIO  Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO  Twenty crowns?
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty times so much upon my wife.

LUCENTIO
A hundred, then.

HORTENSIO  Content.

PETRUCHIO  A match! 'Tis done.

HORTENSIO  Who shall begin?

LUCENTIO  That will I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
