f these
rags, and then death, death.

SHEPHERD'S SON  Alack, poor soul, thou hast need of
more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS  O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends
me more than the stripes I have received, which are
mighty ones and millions.

SHEPHERD'S SON  Alas, poor man, a million of beating
may come to a great matter.

AUTOLYCUS  I am robbed, sir, and beaten, my money
and apparel ta'en from me, and these detestable
things put upon me.

SHEPHER
