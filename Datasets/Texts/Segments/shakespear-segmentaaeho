n'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs.--He turns away.--
Down, ladies! Let us shame him with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down! An end.
[They kneel.]
This is the last. So, we will home to Rome
And die among our neighbors.--Nay, behold 's.
This boy that cannot tell what he would have,
But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny 't.--Come, let us go.
