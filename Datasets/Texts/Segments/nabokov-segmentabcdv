 yours,

PS. My husband reminds me that I forgot to say the quotations for the back cover are O.K. with the exception of the line on Doctor Zhivago, a book which he considers wholly without literary merit.

My husband thanks you for the opportunity offered to answer Edmund Wilson's letter.1 He does not think that pitiful little letter rates a rejoinder.

He thanks you again
