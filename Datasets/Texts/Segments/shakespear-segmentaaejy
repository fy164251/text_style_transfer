THUMUS  More than the world enjoys.

IACHIMO  Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or
she's outprized by a trifle.

POSTHUMUS  You are mistaken. The one may be sold or
given, or if there were wealth enough for the purchase
or merit for the gift. The other is not a thing
for sale, and only the gift of the gods.

IACHIMO  Which the gods have given you?

POSTHUMUS  Which, by their graces, I will keep.

IACHIMO  You may wear her in title yours, but you
know strange fowl light upo
