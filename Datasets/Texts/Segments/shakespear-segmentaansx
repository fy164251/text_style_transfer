TIMON
Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you.
Please you to dispose yourselves.

ALL LADIES  Most thankfully, my lord.
[Cupid and Ladies exit.]

TIMON  Flavius.

FLAVIUS
My lord?

TIMON  The little casket bring me hither.

FLAVIUS  Yes, my lord. [(Aside.)] More jewels yet?
There is no crossing him in 's humor;
