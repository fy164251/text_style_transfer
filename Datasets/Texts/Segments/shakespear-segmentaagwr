 good Volumnius. List a word.

VOLUMNIUS
What says my lord?

BRUTUS  Why this, Volumnius:
The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me
Two several times by night--at Sardis once
And this last night here in Philippi fields.
I know my hour is come.

VOLUMNIUS  Not so, my lord.

BRUTUS
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.
Our enemies have beat us to the pit.	[Low alarums.]
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
Than tarry till they push us. Goo
