
High Emperor, upon my feeble knee
I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed,
That this fell fault of my accursed sons--
Accursed if the faults be proved in them--

SATURNINUS
If it be proved! You see it is apparent.
Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?

TAMORA
Andronicus himself did take it up.

TITUS
I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail,
For by my father's reverend tomb I vow
They shall be ready at your Highness' will
To answer their suspicion with their lives.
