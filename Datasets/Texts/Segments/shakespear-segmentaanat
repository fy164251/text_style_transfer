lady's hand! These be her very c's, her u's, and her
t's, and thus she makes her great P's. It is in
contempt of question her hand.

ANDREW, [aside]  Her c's, her u's, and her t's. Why that?

MALVOLIO [reads]  To the unknown beloved, this, and my
good wishes--Her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
Soft. And the impressure her Lucrece, with which
she uses to seal--'tis my lady! [He opens the letter.]
To whom should this be?
