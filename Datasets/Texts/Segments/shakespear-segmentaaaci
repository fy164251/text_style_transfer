CARRIER  God's body, the turkeys in my pannier
are quite starved.--What, ostler! A plague on thee!
Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Canst not hear?
An 'twere not as good deed as drink to break the
pate on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be
hanged. Hast no faith in thee?

[Enter Gadshill.]


GADSHILL  Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?

FIRST CARRIER  I think it be two o'clock.

GADSHILL  I prithee, lend me thy lantern to see my
gelding in the stable.

FIRST CARRIER
