 I might meet. Hewarned me that in preparing to visit the weird Wonderland of the SovietUnion a traveler's first step was the very Philistine one of being assigneda nomer (hotel room) and that only after he had been granted one could the"visa" be tackled. Over the tawny mountain of "Bogdan's" brown-speckled,butter-soaked, caviar-accompanied bliny (which A.B. forbade me to pay forthough I was lousy with A Kingdom's money), he spoke poetically, and at somelength, about his recent trip to Tel Aviv.
