know me, do you not?

JAILER  For a worthy lady
And one who much I honor.

PAULINA  Pray you then,
Conduct me to the Queen.

JAILER  I may not, madam.
To the contrary I have express commandment.

PAULINA
Here's ado, to lock up honesty and honor from
Th' access of gentle visitors. Is 't lawful, pray you,
To see her women? Any of them? Emilia?

JAILER  So please you, madam,
To put apart these your attendants, I
Shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA  I pray now, call her.--
