larum, and it thunders and lightens.]
What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?

[Enter a Messenger.]


MESSENGER
My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head.
The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle joined,
A holy prophetess new risen up,
Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
[Here Salisbury lifteth himself up and groans.]

TALBOT
Hear, hear, how dying Salisbury doth groan;
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
