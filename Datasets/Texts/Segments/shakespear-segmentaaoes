t I call. [(Lavinia kneels.)] What, wouldst thou
kneel with me?
Do, then, dear heart, for heaven shall hear our
prayers,
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.

MARCUS
O brother, speak with possibility,
And do not break into these deep extremes.

TITUS
Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
Then be my passions bottomless with them.

MARCUS
But yet let reason govern thy lament.
