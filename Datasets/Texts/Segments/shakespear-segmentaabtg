CLIFFORD
What seest thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause?

YORK
With thy brave bearing should I be in love,
But that thou art so fast mine enemy.

CLIFFORD
Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.

YORK
So let it help me now against thy sword
As I in justice and true right express it!

CLIFFORD
My soul and body on the action both!

YORK
A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
[They fight and Clifford falls.]
