r make but thanks,
And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.

You should find better dealing. What's to do?

SEBASTIAN
I am not weary, and 'tis long to night.
I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
With the memorials and the things of fame
That do renown this city.

ANTONIO  Would you'd pardon me
