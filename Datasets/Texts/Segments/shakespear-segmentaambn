redible to believe
How much she loves me. O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.--
Give me thy hand, Kate. I will unto Venice
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day.--
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests.
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
