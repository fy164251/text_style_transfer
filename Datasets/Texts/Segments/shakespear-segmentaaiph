Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar. I prithee pray for me. The
Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's now past it, yet--and I say to thee--
he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt
brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.

No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure scape. Back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tong
