, lusty, young, and proud,
Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,
And forth she rushes, snorts, and neighs aloud.
  The strong-necked steed, being tied unto a tree,
  Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.

Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder.
The bearing Earth with his hard hoof he wounds,
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder.
  The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,
  Controlling what he was controlled with.
