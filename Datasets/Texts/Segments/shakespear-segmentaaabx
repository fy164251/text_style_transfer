n, give me audience for a while.

HOTSPUR
I cry you mercy.

WORCESTER  Those same noble Scots
That are your prisoners--

HOTSPUR  I'll keep them all.
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them.
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.
I'll keep them, by this hand!

WORCESTER  You start away
And lend no ear unto my purposes:
Those prisoners you shall keep--

HOTSPUR  Nay, I will. That's flat!
He said he would not ransom Mortimer,
Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer.
