 From a god to a bull: a heavy descension. It
was Jove's case. From a prince to a 'prentice: a low
transformation that shall be mine, for in everything
the purpose must weigh with the folly. Follow me,
Ned.

[Enter Northumberland, his wife, and the wife to
Harry Percy.]


NORTHUMBERLAND
I pray thee, loving wife and gentle daughter,
Give even way unto my rough affairs.
Put not you on the visage of the times
And be, like them, to Percy troublesome.
