 his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country
Were to us all that do 't and suffer it
A brand to th' end o' th' world.

SICINIUS  This is clean cam.

BRUTUS
Merely awry. When he did love his country,
It honored him.

SICINIUS  The service of the foot,
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS  We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence,
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.
