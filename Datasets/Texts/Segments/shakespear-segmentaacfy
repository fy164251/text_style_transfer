ittle Helen, farewell. If I can remember
thee, I will think of thee at court.

HELEN  Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a
charitable star.

PAROLLES  Under Mars, I.

HELEN  I especially think under Mars.

PAROLLES  Why under Mars?

HELEN  The wars hath so kept you under that you
must needs be born under Mars.

PAROLLES  When he was predominant.

HELEN  When he was retrograde, I think rather.

PAROLLES  Why think you so?

HELEN  You go so much backward when you fight.
