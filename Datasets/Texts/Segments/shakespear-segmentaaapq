evail, if prayers might prevail,
To join your hearts in love and amity.
O, what a scandal is it to our crown
That two such noble peers as you should jar!
Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell
Civil dissension is a viperous worm
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.

[A noise within: "Down with the tawny coats!"]
What tumult 's this?

WARWICK  An uproar, I dare warrant,
Begun through malice of the Bishop's men.
[A noise again: "Stones! Stones!"]

[Enter Mayor.]
