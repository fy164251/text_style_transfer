ruth and Virtue have to do with thee,
A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid.
They buy thy help, but Sin ne'er gives a fee;
He gratis comes, and thou art well apaid
As well to hear as grant what he hath said.
  My Collatine would else have come to me
  When Tarquin did, but he was stayed by thee.

"Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
Guilty of perjury and subornation,
Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
Guilty of incest, that abomination--
An accessory by thine inclination
