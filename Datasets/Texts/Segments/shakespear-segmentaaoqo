[to Gonzalo]  First, noble friend,
Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot
Be measured or confined.

GONZALO  Whether this be
Or be not, I'll not swear.

PROSPERO  You do yet taste
Some subtleties o' th' isle, that will not let you
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all.
[Aside to Sebastian and Antonio.] But you, my brace
of lords, were I so minded,
I here could pluck his Highness' frown upon you
And justify you traitors. At this time
I will tell no tales.

SEBASTIA
