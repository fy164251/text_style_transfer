 bind this man, for he is frantic too.
[Dromio is bound.]

ADRIANA, [to Officer]
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

OFFICER
He is my prisoner. If I let him go,
The debt he owes will be required of me.

ADRIANA
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
And knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.--
Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed
Home to my house.
