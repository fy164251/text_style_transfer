Dear Tony,

Many thanks for the inscribed copy of your View of Venice.1 Such visions as the reversed garlands of wash hanging in the reflected sky of a canal or that shaggy dachshund straining in one direction and the pigeons walking in the other are both witty and poetic.





Cordially yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
