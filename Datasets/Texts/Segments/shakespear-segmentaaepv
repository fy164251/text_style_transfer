ir youth,
Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
By this rude place we live in. Well encountered!
'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it.--
Boys, bid him welcome.

GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Were you a woman, youth,
I should woo hard but be your groom in honesty,
Ay, bid for you as I do buy.

ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  I'll make 't my comfort
He is a man. I'll love him as my brother.--
And such a welcome as I'd give to him
Af
