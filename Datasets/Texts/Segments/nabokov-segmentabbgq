ed to think that an advance for a new translation could be set at $2000. This would not cover notes and comments for which I would want a separate agreement between you and me (the translation would be done by my son). Neither Simon nor Brockway have answered my last letter. I am now going to write them that I consider myself released from my understanding with them. In any case, I am free to undertake a new translation (my son even more so), since they never considered a new translation anyway.
