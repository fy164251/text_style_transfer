Frowns at this levity.--Gentle lords, let's part.
You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost
Anticked us all. What needs more words?
Goodnight.
Good Antony, your hand.

POMPEY  I'll try you on the shore.

ANTONY  And shall, sir. Give 's your hand.

POMPEY
O, Antony, you have my father's house.
But what? We are friends! Come down into the boat.

ENOBARBUS
