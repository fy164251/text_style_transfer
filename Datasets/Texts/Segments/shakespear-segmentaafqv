would talk anon.
[Drum and Trumpet. Chambers discharged.]

WOLSEY  What's that?

CHAMBERLAIN
Look out there, some of you.	[Servants exit.]

WOLSEY  What warlike voice,
And to what end, is this?--Nay, ladies, fear not.
By all the laws of war you're privileged.

[Enter a Servant.]


CHAMBERLAIN
How now, what is 't?

SERVANT  A noble troop of strangers,
For so they seem. They've left their barge and landed,
And hither make, as great ambassadors
From foreign princes.

WOLSEY
