 like soldiers, come and fight it out?

ALANSON  Seigneur, no.

TALBOT
Seigneur, hang! Base muleteers of France,
Like peasant footboys do they keep the walls
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.

PUCELLE
Away, captains. Let's get us from the walls,
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.--
Goodbye, my lord. We came but to tell you
That we are here.	[They exit from the walls.]

TALBOT
And there will we be too, ere it be long,
Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame.--
