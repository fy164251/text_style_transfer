 way to kindle, not to quench.

FIRST SENATOR
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS
What is the city but the people?

ALL PLEBEIANS  True,
The people are the city.

BRUTUS
By the consent of all, we were established
The people's magistrates.

ALL PLEBEIANS  You so remain.

MENENIUS  And so are like to do.

CORIOLANUS
That is the way to lay the city flat,
To bring the roof to the foundation
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
In heaps and piles of ruin.
