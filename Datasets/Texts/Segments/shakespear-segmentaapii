
CAMILLO  Beseech you--

ARCHIDAMUS  Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my
knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence--in
so rare--I know not what to say. We will give you
sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our
insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as
little accuse us.

CAMILLO  You pay a great deal too dear for what's given
freely.

ARCHIDAMUS  Believe me, I speak as my understanding
instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to
utterance.

CAMILLO
