ards, not 3x5.

My remarks about Solzhenitsyn and Bellow were not for print.

I was sorry you quoted me on Catholic converts, it was mere gossip, and Vidal's4 response, in that footnote, was silly and vulgar.

If my conjecture is wrong and the essay you propose to publish is a different one, in which you do not quote me at all, then I shall be glad to oblige you and have Miss Krementz come here for a photograph session between the 5th and 19th of March.





Yours cordially,

Vladimir Nabokov
