you meant by that.

WIDOW
Your husband being troubled with a shrew
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe.
And now you know my meaning.

KATHERINE
A very mean meaning.

WIDOW  Right, I mean you.

KATHERINE
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

PETRUCHIO  To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO  To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

HORTENSIO  That's my office.

PETRUCHIO
Spoke like an officer! Ha' to thee, lad.
[He drinks to Hortensio.]
