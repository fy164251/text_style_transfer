.
Call Claudius and some other of my men;
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

LUCIUS  Varro and Claudius.

[Enter Varro and Claudius.]


VARRO  Calls my lord?

BRUTUS
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep.
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius.

VARRO
So please you, we will stand and watch your
pleasure.

BRUTUS
I will not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
[They lie down.]
Look, Lucius
