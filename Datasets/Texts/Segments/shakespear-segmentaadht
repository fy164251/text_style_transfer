BROTHER
Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece,
And she is dead, slandered to death by villains
That dare as well answer a man indeed
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.--
Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!

Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple--
Scambling, outfacing, fashionmonging boys,

Go anticly and show outward
