n. How shall we
try it?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE  We'll draw cuts for the signior.
Till then, lead thou first.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS  Nay, then, thus:
We came into the world like brother and brother,
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before
another.

PROLOGUE

[Enter Chorus as Prologue.]


CHORUS
O, for a muse of fire that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention!
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
