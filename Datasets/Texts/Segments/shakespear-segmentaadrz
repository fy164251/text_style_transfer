 becomes of me,
This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukable
And worthy shameful check it were to stand
On more mechanic compliment. I'll leave thee
Now like a man of steel.--You that will fight,
Follow me close. I'll bring you to 't.--Adieu.
[Antony, Eros, Captains, and Soldiers exit.]

CHARMIAN
Please you retire to your chamber?

CLEOPATRA  Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight,
Then Antony--but now--. Well, on.
[They exit.]
