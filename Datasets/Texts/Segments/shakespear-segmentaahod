 Do not so.

KATHERINE
Then die a calf before your horns do grow.

LONGAVILLE
One word in private with you ere I die.

KATHERINE
Bleat softly, then. The butcher hears you cry.
[They move aside.]

BOYET
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
   As is the razor's edge invisible,
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen;
   Above the sense of sense, so sensible
Seemeth their conference. Their conceits have
wings
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter
things.
