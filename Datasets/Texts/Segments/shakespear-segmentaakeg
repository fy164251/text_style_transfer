 tune,
And sweet revenge grows harsh.

DESDEMONA  O falsely, falsely murdered.

EMILIA
O Lord, what cry is that?

OTHELLO  That? What?

EMILIA
Out, and alas, that was my lady's voice!
Help! Help ho! Help! O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!

DESDEMONA  A guiltless death I die.

EMILIA  O, who hath done this deed?

DESDEMONA  Nobody. I myself. Farewell.
Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell.
[She dies.]

OTHELLO
Why, how should she be murdered?
