y these removes.
[Katherine and Maria exchange favors.]

ROSALINE
Come on, then, wear the favors most in sight.

KATHERINE, [to Princess]
But in this changing, what is your intent?

PRINCESS
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
They do it but in mockery merriment,
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mocked withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet,
With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
