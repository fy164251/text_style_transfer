That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant
I have not seen these two days.

QUEEN  Go, look after.
[Cloten exits.]
[Aside.] Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus--
He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seized her,
Or, winged with fervor of her love, she's flown
To her desired Posthumus. Gone she is
To death or to dishonor,
