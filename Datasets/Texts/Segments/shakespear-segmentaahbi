
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
Forethought by heaven!

BLANCHE, [to Dauphin]
Now shall I see thy love. What motive may
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?

CONSTANCE
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
His honor.--O, thine honor, Louis, thine honor!

DAUPHIN, [to King Philip]
I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold,
When such profound respects do pull you on.

PANDULPH
I will denounce a curse upon his head.

KING PHILIP, [dropping King John's hand]
