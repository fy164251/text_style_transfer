Major Sleeman wrote forty or fifty years ago (the italics are mine):

     “I would here enter my humble protest against the quadrille and
     lunch parties which are sometimes given to European ladies and
     gentlemen of the station at this imperial tomb; drinking and dancing
     are no doubt very good things in their season, but they are sadly
     out of place in a sepulchre.”

Were there any Americans among those lunch parties?  If they were
invited, there were.
