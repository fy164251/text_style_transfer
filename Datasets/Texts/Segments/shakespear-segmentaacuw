ND  O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.

CELIA  I would sing my song without a burden. Thou
bring'st me out of tune.

ROSALIND  Do you not know I am a woman? When I

CELIA  You bring me out.

[Enter Orlando and Jaques.]

ROSALIND  'Tis he. Slink by, and note him.
[Rosalind and Celia step aside.]

JAQUES, [to Orlando]  I thank you for your company,
but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.

ORLANDO
