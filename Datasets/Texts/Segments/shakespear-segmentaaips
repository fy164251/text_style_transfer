ic oft hath such a charm
To make bad good and good provoke to harm.
I pray you tell me, hath anybody inquired for me
here today? Much upon this time have I promised
here to meet.

MARIANA  You have not been inquired after. I have sat
here all day.

[Enter Isabella.]


DUKE, [as Friar]  I do constantly believe you. The time is
come even now. I shall crave your forbearance a
little. Maybe I will call upon you anon for some
advantage to yourself.

MARIANA  I am always bound to you.
