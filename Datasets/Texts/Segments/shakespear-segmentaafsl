sufferance panging
As soul and body's severing.

OLD LADY  Alas, poor lady,
She's a stranger now again!

ANNE  So much the more
Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born
And range with humble livers in content
Than to be perked up in a glist'ring grief
And wear a golden sorrow.

OLD LADY  Our content
Is our best having.

ANNE  By my troth and maidenhead,
I would not be a queen.

OLD LADY  Beshrew me, I would,
And venture maidenhead for 't; and so
