The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream
And greedily devour the treacherous bait.
So angle we for Beatrice, who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.

HERO, [aside to Ursula]
Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.--
[They walk near the bower.]
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As hagga
