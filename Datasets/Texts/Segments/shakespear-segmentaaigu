not bought
Basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate.
For me, I am the mistress of my fate
  And with my trespass never will dispense
  Till life to death acquit my forced offense.

"I will not poison thee with my attaint,
Nor fold my fault in cleanly coined excuses;
My sable ground of sin I will not paint
To hide the truth of this false night's abuses.
My tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,
  As from a mountain spring that feeds a dale,
  Shall gush pure streams
