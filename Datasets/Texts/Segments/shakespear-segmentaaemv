To send it me.

IACHIMO  She writes so to you, doth she?

POSTHUMUS
O, no, no, no, 'tis true. Here, take this too.
[He gives Iachimo the ring.]
It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
Kills me to look on 't. Let there be no honor
Where there is beauty, truth where semblance, love
Where there's another man. The vows of women
Of no more bondage be to where they are made
Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
O, above measure false!
