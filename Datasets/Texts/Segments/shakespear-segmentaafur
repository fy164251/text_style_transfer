nions, which
Have satisfied the King for his divorce,
Together with all famous colleges
Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,
His second marriage shall be published, and
Her coronation. Katherine no more
Shall be called queen, but princess dowager
And widow to Prince Arthur.

NORFOLK  This same Cranmer's
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
In the King's business.

SUFFOLK  He has, and we shall see him
For it an archbishop.

NORFOLK  So I hear.

SUFFOLK  'Tis so.
