o, my good lord, I am the very man--

LEAR  I'll see that straight.

KENT
That from your first of difference and decay
Have followed your sad steps.

LEAR  You are welcome
hither.

KENT
Nor no man else. All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
And desperately are dead.

LEAR  Ay, so I think.

ALBANY
He knows not what he says, and vain is it
That we present us to him.

EDGAR  Very bootless.
