 it was November last year: in the course of a polemic Russian exchange in Novoe Russkpe Slovo1 involving Yanovski, Marc Slonim and Kuskova,2 you were mentioned as one of the gifted poets of the Prague group in the old days. Have you written anything lately?

Sincères amitiés to both of you from us both.





Tvoy V.
