Look how I am bewitched! Behold mine arm
Is like a blasted sapling withered up;
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

HASTINGS
If they have done this deed, my noble lord--

RICHARD
If? Thou protector of this damned strumpet,
Talk'st thou to me of "ifs"? Thou art a traitor.--
Off with his head. Now by Saint Paul I swear
I will not dine until I see the same.--
Lovell and Ratcliffe,
