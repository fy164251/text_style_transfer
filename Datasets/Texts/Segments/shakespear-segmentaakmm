to it to know of whence you are.

HELICANUS  First, what is your place?

LYSIMACHUS
I am the governor of this place you lie before.

HELICANUS  Sir,
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the King,
A man who for this three months hath not spoken
To anyone, nor taken sustenance
But to prorogue his grief.

LYSIMACHUS
Upon what ground is his distemperature?

HELICANUS  'Twould be too tedious to repeat,
But the main grief springs from the loss
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.

LYSIMACHUS
