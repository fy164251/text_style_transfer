PAULINA  As she lived peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
Excels whatever yet you looked upon
Or hand of man hath done. Therefore I keep it
Lonely, apart. But here it is. Prepare
To see the life as lively mocked as ever
Still sleep mocked death. Behold, and say 'tis well.
[She draws a curtain
to reveal Hermione (like a statue).]
I like your silence. It the more shows off
Your wonder. But yet speak. First you, my liege.
Comes it not something near?
