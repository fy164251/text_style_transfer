ber banks, and weep your tears
Into the channel, till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
[All the Commoners exit.]
See whe'er their basest mettle be not moved.
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol.
This way will I. Disrobe the images
If you do find them decked with ceremonies.

MARULLUS  May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

FLAVIUS
It is no matter. Let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies.
