e vulgar sort of market men
That come to gather money for their corn.
If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.

SOLDIER
Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
And we be lords and rulers over Roan;
Therefore we'll knock.
[Knock.]

WATCH, [within]
Qui la?
