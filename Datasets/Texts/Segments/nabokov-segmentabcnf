 we shall see both you as a venerable old man, and your country's spring butterflies. Last year we did our hunting in Sicily.

Things are unchanged here since our Zermatt meeting nine years ago. Mityusha is singing in America. I am writing a new book. A collection of my poems (Russian and English) and chess problems is being published3—I'll send it. I have transmitted a copy of the letter you sent to the diligent and indefatigable Field.





I embrace you and Véra sends greetings.

Vladimir
