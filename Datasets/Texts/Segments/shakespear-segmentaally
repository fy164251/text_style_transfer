us Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here this long-usurped royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I plucked off, to grace thy brows withal.
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

RICHMOND

But tell me, is young George Stanley living?

STANLEY
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

RICHMOND
What men of name are slain on either side?

STANLEY
John, Duke of No
