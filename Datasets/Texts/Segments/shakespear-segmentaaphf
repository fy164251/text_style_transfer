 cheering up her senses all dismayed,
She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy
And childish error that they are afraid,
  Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more--
  And with that word she spied the hunted boar,

Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,
Like milk and blood being mingled both together,
A second fear through all her sinews spread,
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither;
  This way she runs, and now she will no further
  But back retires to rate the boar
