uch a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.

DEMETRIUS  A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus,
which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, God
warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us.

LYSANDER  She hath spied him already with those
sweet eyes.

DEMETRIUS  And thus she means, videlicet--

FLUTE, [as Thisbe]
	      Asleep, my love?
	      What, dead, my dove?
	   O Pyramus, arise!
	      Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
	      Dead? Dead? A tomb
	   Must cover thy sweet eyes.
