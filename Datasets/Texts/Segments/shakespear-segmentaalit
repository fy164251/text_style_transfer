ed your
Grace
To breakfast once, forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your eye,
Let me march on and not offend you, madam.--
Strike up the drum.

DUCHESS  I prithee, hear me speak.

RICHARD
You speak too bitterly.

DUCHESS  Hear me a word,
For I shall never speak to thee again.

RICHARD  So.

DUCHESS
Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And nevermore behold thy face again.
