ess you, Captain Parolles.

FIRST LORD  God save you, noble captain.

SECOND LORD  Captain, what greeting will you to my
Lord Lafew? I am for France.

FIRST LORD  Good captain, will you give me a copy of
the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count
Rossillion? An I were not a very coward, I'd compel
it of you. But fare you well.
[Bertram and Lords exit.]

FIRST SOLDIER  You are undone, captain--all but your
scarf; that has a knot on 't yet.

PAROLLES  Who cannot be crushed
