es the first thrust, I'll kill him. By this sword, I
will.

PISTOL, [sheathing his sword]  "Sword" is an oath, and
oaths must have their course.

BARDOLPH  Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be
friends; an thou wilt not, why then be enemies with
me too. Prithee, put up.

PISTOL, [to Nym]  A noble shalt thou have, and present
pay, and liquor likewise will I give to thee, and
friendship shall combine, and brotherhood. I'll live
by Nym, and Nym shall live by me. Is not this just?
