Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.

Ay, when the special thing is well obtained,
That is, her love, for that is all in all.

And where two raging fires meet together,
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
