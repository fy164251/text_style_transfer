ay. By Jove, I will not speak a word.
There is between my will and all offenses
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.

THERSITES, [aside]  How the devil Luxury, with his fat
rump and potato finger, tickles these together.
Fry, lechery, fry!

DIOMEDES  But will you, then?

CRESSIDA
In faith, I will, la. Never trust me else.

DIOMEDES
Give me some token for the surety of it.

CRESSIDA  I'll fetch you one.	[She exits.]

ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]
You have sworn patience.
