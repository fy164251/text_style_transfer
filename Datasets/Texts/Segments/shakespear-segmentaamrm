 as yourself.
Upon a homely object, Love can wink.

SYLVIA
Have done, have done. Here comes the gentleman.

[Enter Proteus.]


VALENTINE
Welcome, dear Proteus.--Mistress, I beseech you
Confirm his welcome with some special favor.

SYLVIA
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
If this be he you oft have wished to hear from.

VALENTINE
Mistress, it is. Sweet lady, entertain him
To be my fellow-servant to your Ladyship.

SYLVIA
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
