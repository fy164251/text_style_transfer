hy advice,
And I will give a taste thereof forthwith
To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.
Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone
Must tar the mastiffs on, as 'twere a bone.

ACT 2

Scene 1
=======
[Enter Ajax and Thersites.]


AJAX  Thersites!

THERSITES  Agamemnon--how if he had boils, full, all
over, generally?

AJAX  Thersites!

THERSITES  And those boils did run? Say so. Did not the
general run, then? Were not that a botchy core?

AJAX  Dog!
