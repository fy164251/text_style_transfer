 in the clear sky of
fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth
the cinders of the element (which show like pins'
heads to her), believe not the word of the noble.
Therefore let me have right, and let desert mount.

JOHN OF LANCASTER  Thine's too heavy to mount.

FALSTAFF  Let it shine, then.

JOHN OF LANCASTER  Thine's too thick to shine.

FALSTAFF  Let it do something, my good lord, that may
do me good, and call it what you will.

JOHN OF LANCASTER  Is thy name Colevile?
