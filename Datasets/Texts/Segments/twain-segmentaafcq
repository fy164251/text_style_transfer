gled in thought over the baffling situation; then Mrs. Enderby
brightened and said:

â€œI think I've got the idea, now.  You see, we can't walk any more.  Think
what we've done: four miles there, two to Moseley's, is six, then back to
here--nine miles since noon, and not a bite to eat; I declare I don't see
how we've done it; and as for me, I am just famishing.  Now, somebody's
got to go back, to help Mr. Brown--there's no getting around that; but
whoever goes has got to ride, not walk.
