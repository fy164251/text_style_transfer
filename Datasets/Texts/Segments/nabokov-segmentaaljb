ying, Lolita Haze,

Of hate and remorse, I’m dying.

And again my hairy fist I raise,

And again I hear you crying.



Officer, officer, there they go—

Dolores Haze and her lover!

Whip out your gun and follow that car.

Now tumble out, and take cover.



Wanted, wanted: Dolores Haze.

Her dream-gray gaze never flinches.

Ninety pound
