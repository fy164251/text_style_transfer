look no more
Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong.

GLOUCESTER  Set me where you stand.

EDGAR
Give me your hand. You are now within a foot
Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright.

GLOUCESTER  Let go my hand.
Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee.	[He gives Edgar a purse.]
Go thou further off.
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
