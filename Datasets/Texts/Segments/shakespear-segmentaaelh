us and your lord--
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
To buy a present for the Emperor;
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
In France. 'Tis plate of rare device and jewels
Of rich and exquisite form, their values great.
And I am something curious, being strange,
To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
To take them in protection?

IMOGEN  Willingly;
And pawn mine honor for their safety. Since
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
In my bedchambe
