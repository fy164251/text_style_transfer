KE  Yet ask.

KING RICHARD  And shall I have?

BOLINGBROKE  You shall.

KING RICHARD  Then give me leave to go.

BOLINGBROKE  Whither?

KING RICHARD
Whither you will, so I were from your sights.

BOLINGBROKE
Go, some of you, convey him to the Tower.

KING RICHARD
O, good! "Convey"? Conveyers are you all,
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
[Richard exits with Guards.]

BOLINGBROKE
On Wednesday next, we solemnly set down
Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.
