not anything
In the pretended celebration.--Queens,
Follow your soldier. [To Artesius.] As before, hence
you,
And at the banks of Aulis meet us with
The forces you can raise, where we shall find
The moiety of a number for a business
More bigger looked.	[Artesius exits.]
[To Hippolyta.] Since that our theme is haste,
I stamp this kiss upon thy currant lip;
Sweet, keep it as my token.--Set you forward,
For I will see you gone.
[The wedding procession begins to exit
towards the temple.
