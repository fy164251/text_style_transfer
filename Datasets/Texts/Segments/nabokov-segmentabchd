Dear Mr. Macauley,

I thank you for your letter of June 6 with which were enclosed chapters 8 and 12 of my KING, QUEEN, KNAVE.

Your suggestion that I make a new story using the elements of these chapters is amusing but completely unacceptable.

Will you kindly return the rest of the typescript to me at the following address:

Cita Grand Hotel

Limone Piemonte (Cuneo)

Italy.





Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
