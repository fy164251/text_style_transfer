lier, and still prevents me from writing you in detail. I have now read Sokolov's1 SHKOLA DLYA DURAKOV, an enchanting, tragic, and touching book (I translate this comment in case you might like to transmit it to the author: obayatel'naya, tragicheskaya i trogatel'neyshaya kniga). It is by far the best thing you have published in the way of modern Soviet prose.





Cordially yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
