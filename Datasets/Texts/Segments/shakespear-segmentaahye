
How now? Where's the King?

OSWALD
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.
Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights,
Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,
Who, with some other of the lord's dependents,
Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast
To have well-armed friends.

CORNWALL  Get horses for your mistress.
[Oswald exits.]

GONERIL  Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

CORNWALL
Edmund, farewell.	[Goneril and Edmund exit.]
Go seek the traitor Gloucester.
