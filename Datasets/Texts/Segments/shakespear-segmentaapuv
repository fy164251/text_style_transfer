FALSTAFF  Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good
trade. An old cloak makes a new jerkin, a withered
servingman a fresh tapster. Go. Adieu.

BARDOLPH  It is a life that I have desired. I will thrive.

PISTOL  O base Hungarian wight, wilt thou the spigot
wield?	[Bardolph exits.]

NYM  He was gotten in drink. Is not the humor
conceited?

FALSTAFF  I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox.
