st of you all.
Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence
And give them burial as beseems their worth.

PUCELLE
I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.
For God's sake, let him have him. To keep them here,
They would but stink and putrefy the air.

CHARLES
Go, take their bodies hence.

LUCY  I'll bear them hence.
But from their ashes shall be reared
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.

CHARLES
So we be rid of them
