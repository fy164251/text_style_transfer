 asked the question. Poor rogues
and usurers' men, bawds between gold and want.

ALL THE MEN  What are we, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS  Asses.

ALL THE MEN  Why?

APEMANTUS  That you ask me what you are, and do not
know yourselves.--Speak to 'em, Fool.

FOOL  How do you, gentlemen?

ALL THE MEN  Gramercies, good Fool. How does your
mistress?

FOOL  She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!

APEMANTUS  Good. Gramercy.
