n the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallowed, and
The fraughting souls within her.

PROSPERO  Be collected.
No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.

MIRANDA  O, woe the day!

PROSPERO  No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.
