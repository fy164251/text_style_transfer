ty ring time,
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
	Sweet lovers love the spring.

	Between the acres of the rye,
	   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,
	These pretty country folks would lie
	   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
	Sweet lovers love the spring.

	This carol they began that hour,
	   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,
	How that a life was but a flower
	   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
