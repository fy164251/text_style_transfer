ANTONY  All is lost!
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together
Like friends long lost. Triple-turned whore! 'Tis thou
Hast sold me to this novice, and my heart
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly--
For when I am revenged upon my charm,
I have done all. Bid them all fly. Begone!
[Scarus exits.]
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more.
Fortune and Antony part here; even here
