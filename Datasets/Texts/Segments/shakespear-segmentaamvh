I'll be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he
hath stolen; otherwise he had been executed. I have
stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed; otherwise
he had suffered for 't. [To Crab.] Thou think'st
not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you
served me when I took my leave of Madam Sylvia.
Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do?
When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? Didst
thou ever see me do such a trick?
