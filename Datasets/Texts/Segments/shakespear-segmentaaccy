CLARENCE
A little fire is quickly trodden out,
Which, being suffered, rivers cannot quench.

WARWICK
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war.
Those will I muster up; and thou, son Clarence,
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee.--
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
Northampton, and in Leicestershire shalt find
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st.
