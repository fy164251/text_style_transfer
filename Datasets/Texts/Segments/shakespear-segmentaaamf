Joan la Pucelle overcomes.]

CHARLES
Stay, stay thy hands! Thou art an Amazon,
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.

PUCELLE
Christ's mother helps me; else I were too weak.

CHARLES

My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be.
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
