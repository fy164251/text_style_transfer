ir, welcome.
It is my father's will I should take on me
The hostess-ship o' th' day. [To Camillo.] You're
welcome, sir.--
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas.--Reverend
sirs,
For you there's rosemary and rue. These keep
Seeming and savor all the winter long.
Grace and remembrance be to you both,
And welcome to our shearing.

POLIXENES  Shepherdess--
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
With flowers of winter.

PERDITA  Sir, the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's death
