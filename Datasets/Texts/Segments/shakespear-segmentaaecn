 One word more, one word!
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscanned swiftness, will too late
Tie leaden pounds to 's heels. Proceed by process,
Lest parties--as he is beloved--break out
And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS  If it were so--

SICINIUS  What do you talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smote! Ourselves resisted! Come.

MENENIUS
Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill schooled
