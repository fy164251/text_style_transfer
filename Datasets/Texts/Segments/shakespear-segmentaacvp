ds had made thee poetical.

AUDREY  I do not know what "poetical" is. Is it honest
in deed and word? Is it a true thing?

TOUCHSTONE  No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most
feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do
feign.

AUDREY  Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me
poetical?

TOUCHSTONE  I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou
art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have
some hope thou didst feign.
