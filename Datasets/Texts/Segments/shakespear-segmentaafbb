NT
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

SECOND MERCHANT
These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
Fie on thee, wretch. 'Tis pity that thou liv'st
To walk where any honest men resort.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus.
I'll prove mine honor and mine honesty
Against thee presently if thou dar'st stand.

SECOND MERCHANT
I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.	[They draw.]
