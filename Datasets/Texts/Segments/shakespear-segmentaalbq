gs of conscience
are yet within me.

FIRST MURDERER  Remember our reward when the
deed's done.

SECOND MURDERER  Zounds, he dies! I had forgot the
reward.

FIRST MURDERER  Where's thy conscience now?

SECOND MURDERER  O, in the Duke of Gloucester's
purse.

FIRST MURDERER  When he opens his purse to give us
our reward, thy conscience flies out.

SECOND MURDERER  'Tis no matter. Let it go. There's
few or none will entertain it.

FIRST MURDERER  What if it come to thee again?
