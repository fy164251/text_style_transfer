to his hands, and commands shall
be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman
hand.

OLIVIA  Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO  To bed? "Ay, sweetheart, and I'll come to
thee."

OLIVIA  God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and
kiss thy hand so oft?

MARIA  How do you, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO  At your request? Yes, nightingales answer
daws!

MARIA  Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness
before my lady?

MALVOLIO  "Be not afraid of greatness." 'Twas well
writ.
