PEED
Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.

VALENTINE
Ha? Let me see. Ay, give it me, it's mine.
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
Ah, Sylvia, Sylvia!

SPEED, [calling]  Madam Sylvia! Madam Sylvia!

VALENTINE  How now, sirrah?

SPEED  She is not within hearing, sir.

VALENTINE  Why, sir, who bade you call her?

SPEED  Your Worship, sir, or else I mistook.

VALENTINE  Well, you'll still be too forward.

SPEED  And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
