MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Away, away, mad ass! His
name is Lucentio and he is mine only son, and heir
to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

VINCENTIO  Lucentio? O, he hath murdered his master!
Lay hold on him, I charge you in the Duke's name.
O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is
my son Lucentio?

TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Call forth an officer.

[Enter an Officer.]

Carry this mad knave to the jail.--
