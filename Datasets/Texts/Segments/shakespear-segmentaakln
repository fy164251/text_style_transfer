lowed some part o' th' earth.
	Therefore the Earth, fearing to be o'erflowed,
	Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestowed.
	Wherefore she does--and swears she'll never stint--
	Make raging battery upon shores of flint.

No visor does become black villainy
So well as soft and tender flattery.
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
And bear his courses to be ordered
By Lady Fortune, while our scene must play
His daughter's woe and heavy welladay
In her unholy service. Patience
