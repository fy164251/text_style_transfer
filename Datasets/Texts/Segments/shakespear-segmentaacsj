prizer of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
O, what a world is this when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it!

ORLANDO  Why, what's the matter?

ADAM  O unhappy youth,
Come not within these doors. Within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives.
Your brother--no, no broth
