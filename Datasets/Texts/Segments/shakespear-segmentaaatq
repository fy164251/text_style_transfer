CHARLES
These news, my lords, may cheer our drooping spirits:
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
And turn again unto the warlike French.

ALANSON
Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.

PUCELLE
Peace be amongst them if they turn to us;
Else ruin combat with their palaces!

[Enter Scout.]


SCOUT
Success unto our valiant general,
And happiness to his accomplices.

CHARLES
What tidings send our scouts? I prithee speak.
