t this ground,
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
Thou art my brother, so we'll hold thee ever.

IMOGEN, [to Belarius]
You are my father too, and did relieve me
To see this gracious season.

CYMBELINE  All o'erjoyed
Save these in bonds; let them be joyful too,
For they shall taste our comfort.

IMOGEN, [to Lucius]  My good master,
I will yet do you service.

LUCIUS  Happy be you!

CYMBELINE
The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought,
He would have well becomed this place
