 be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father.--Blossom, speed thee well.
There lie, and there thy character; there these,
[He lays down the baby, a bundle, and a box.]
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still rest thine. [Thunder.] The storm begins.
Poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow. Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds, and most accurst am I
To be by oath enjoined to this. Farewell.
