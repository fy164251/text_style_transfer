August 1960 contains some absurd misstatements:



"...said Mrs. Nabokov calmly, '...when we were very poor in Paris I supported him by working as a milliner, and he has always been so grateful that he never gets angry at me.'"

My wife never worked as a milliner, nor in any other shop, and anyway could not have made that trite and silly remark.

Her father was not "the former owner of the largest and most important publishing house in Russia." He was an industrialist, and a jurist by education.
