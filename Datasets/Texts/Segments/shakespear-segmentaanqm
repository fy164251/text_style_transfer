ESEUS
Lo, where our sister is in expectation,
Yet quaking and unsettled.--Fairest Emily,
The gods by their divine arbitrament
Have given you this knight; he is a good one
As ever struck at head.--Give me your hands.
Receive you her, you him. Be plighted with
A love that grows as you decay.

ARCITE  Emily,
To buy you I have lost what's dearest to me
Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply,
As I do rate your value.

THESEUS  O loved sister,
He speaks now of as brave a knight
