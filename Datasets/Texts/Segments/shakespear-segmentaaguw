ynic rhyme!

BRUTUS
Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence!

CASSIUS
Bear with him, Brutus. 'Tis his fashion.

BRUTUS
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?--
Companion, hence!

CASSIUS  Away, away, be gone!	[Poet exits.]

BRUTUS
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.

CASSIUS
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us.	[Lucilius and Titinius exit.]
