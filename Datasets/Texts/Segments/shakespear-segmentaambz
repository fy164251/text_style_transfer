
BIANCA
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
I am no breeching scholar in the schools.
I'll not be tied to hours, nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down.
[To Hortensio.] Take you your instrument, play you
the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO, [aside]
That will be never.
