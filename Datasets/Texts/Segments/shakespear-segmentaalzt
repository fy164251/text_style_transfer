 grace
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,
That so I may, by this device at least,
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected court her by herself.

GRUMIO  Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old
folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!

[Enter Gremio and Lucentio, disguised as Cambio, a
schoolmaster.]

Master, master, look about you. Who goes there, ha?

HORTENSIO
Peace,
