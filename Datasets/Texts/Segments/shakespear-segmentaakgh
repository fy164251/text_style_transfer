rease not but grow faster than the years;
And should he doubt, as no doubt he doth,
That I should open to the list'ning air
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
To lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms,
And make pretense of wrong that I have done him;
When all, for mine--if I may call 't--offense,
Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence;
Which love to all--of which thyself art one,
Who now reproved'st me for 't--
