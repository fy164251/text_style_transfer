r.--Father, by your leave,
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
Give me this maid, your daughter?

LEONATO
As freely, son, as God did give her me.

CLAUDIO
And what have I to give you back whose worth
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?

PRINCE
Nothing, unless you render her again.

CLAUDIO
Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.--
There, Leonato, take her back again.
Give not this rotten orange to your friend.
She's but the sign and semblance of her honor
