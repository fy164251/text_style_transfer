lp me to my closet.--
Ah, poor Clarence.
[Some exit with King and Queen.]

RICHARD
This is the fruits of rashness. Marked you not
How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the King.
God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
To comfort Edward with our company?

BUCKINGHAM  We wait upon your Grace.
[They exit.]
