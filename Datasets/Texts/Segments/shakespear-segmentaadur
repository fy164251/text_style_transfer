SELEUCUS  Here, madam.

CLEOPATRA
This is my treasurer. Let him speak, my lord,
Upon his peril, that I have reserved
To myself nothing.--Speak the truth, Seleucus.

SELEUCUS
Madam, I had rather seel my lips
Than to my peril speak that which is not.

CLEOPATRA  What have I kept back?

SELEUCUS
Enough to purchase what you have made known.

CAESAR
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra. I approve
Your wisdom in the deed.

CLEOPATRA  See, Caesar, O, behold
How pomp is followed! Mine
