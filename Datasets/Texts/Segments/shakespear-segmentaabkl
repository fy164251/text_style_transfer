of hawking; nothing else, my lord.
[(Aside to Cardinal.)] Now, by God's mother, priest,
I'll shave your crown for this,
Or all my fence shall fail.

CARDINAL, [aside to Gloucester]  Medice, teipsum;
Protector, see to 't well; protect yourself.

KING HENRY
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
How irksome is this music to my heart!
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.

[Enter a man from St. Albans crying "A miracle!"]
