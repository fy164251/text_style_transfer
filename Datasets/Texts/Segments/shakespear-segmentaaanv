PUCELLE
Question, my lords, no further of the case,
How or which way; 'tis sure they found some place
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
And now there rests no other shift but this:
To gather our soldiers, scattered and dispersed,
And lay new platforms to endamage them.

[Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying,
"A Talbot, A Talbot!" The French fly,
leaving their clothes behind.]


SOLDIER
I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
