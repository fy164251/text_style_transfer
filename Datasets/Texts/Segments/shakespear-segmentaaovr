Amen.

ACHILLES, [within]  Who's there?

PATROCLUS  Thersites, my lord.

ACHILLES, [within]  Where? Where? O, where?

[Enter Achilles.]

[To Thersites.] Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my
digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my
table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?

THERSITES  Thy commander, Achilles.--Then, tell me,
Patroclus, what's Achilles?

PATROCLUS  Thy lord, Thersites. Then, tell me, I pray
thee, what's Thersites?

THERSITES  Thy knower, Patroclus.
