Dear Mr. Booher,

Thanks a lot for your letter of congratulation.1 Never before have I thought of my writing career in terms of prizes or rewards,â€”or even praise and flattering reviews. But I must truthfully admit that this recognition in the country that I consider my own warms my heart.

My wife and I shall be looking forward to seeing you again in the spring in New York.

Sincerely,

Vladimir Nabokov
