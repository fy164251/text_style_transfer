What do you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.

RICHARD
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
And do intend to make her Queen of England.

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

RICHARD
Even he that makes her queen. Who else should be?

QUEEN ELIZABETH
What, thou?
