ed buried in my sorrow's grave.
Marry, would the word "farewell" have lengthened
hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have had a volume of farewells.
But since it would not, he had none of me.

KING RICHARD
He is our cousin, cousin, but 'tis doubt,
When time shall call him home from banishment,
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,
Observed his courtship to the common people,
How he did seem to dive into their heart
