CESS
What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
What vane? What weathercock? Did you ever hear
better?

BOYET
I am much deceived but I remember the style.

PRINCESS
Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.

BOYET
This Armado is a Spaniard that keeps here in court,
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes
sport
To the Prince and his bookmates.

PRINCESS, [to Costard]  Thou, fellow, a word.
Who gave thee this letter?

COSTARD  I told you: my lord.
