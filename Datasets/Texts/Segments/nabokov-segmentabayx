appearance of an article on the same subject and lines in some other periodical before I had quite finished mine.1

I did have the pleasure of meeting you. In fact I came all the way, across some hilly country, to the anniversary reception at the Carlton last March and said to you (in allusion to our indirect meetings through Katharine White in all kinds of verbal jungles): "Dr. Ross, I presume?" You said you were not a doctor.

I hope to have an opportunity to see you again.

Sincerely yours,
