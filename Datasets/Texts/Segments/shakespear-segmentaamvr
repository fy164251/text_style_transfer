Madam, he sends your Ladyship this ring.
[She offers Sylvia a ring.]

SYLVIA
The more shame for him, that he sends it me;
For I have heard him say a thousand times
His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.

JULIA, [as Sebastian]  She thanks you.

SYLVIA  What sayst thou?

JULIA, [as Sebastian]
I thank you
