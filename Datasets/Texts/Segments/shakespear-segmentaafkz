What is thy name? Discuss.

FRENCH SOLDIER  O Seigneur Dieu!

PISTOL  O, Seigneur Dew should be a gentleman. Perpend
my words, O Seigneur Dew, and mark: O
Seigneur Dew, thou diest on point of fox, except, O
Seigneur, thou do give to me egregious ransom.

FRENCH SOLDIER  O, prenez misericorde! Ayez pitie de
moi!

PISTOL  Moy shall not serve. I will have forty moys, or
I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat in drops of
crimson blood.
