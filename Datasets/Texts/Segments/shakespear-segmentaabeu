
WARWICK, [to an Attendant]
Call for the music in the other room.

KING
Set me the crown upon my pillow here.
[The crown is placed on the bed.]

THOMAS OF CLARENCE, [aside to the others]
His eye is hollow, and he changes much.

WARWICK
Less noise, less noise.

[Enter Prince Harry.]


PRINCE  Who saw the Duke of Clarence?

THOMAS OF CLARENCE, [weeping]
I am here, brother, full of heaviness.

PRINCE
How now, rain within doors, and none abroad?
How doth the King?
