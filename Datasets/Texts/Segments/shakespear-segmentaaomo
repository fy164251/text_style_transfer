 from thee, and a birth indeed
Which throes thee much to yield.

ANTONIO  Thus, sir:
Although this lord of weak remembrance--this,
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earthed--hath here almost persuaded--
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade--the King his son's alive,
'Tis as impossible that he's undrowned
As he that sleeps here swims.

SEBASTIAN  I have no hope
That he's undrowned.

ANTONIO  O, out of that no hope
What great hope have you! No hope
