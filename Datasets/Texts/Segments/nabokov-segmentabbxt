rre, I must ask you to publish all four cantos. The novel is going to take several more months to finish, and there might be some showable parts later on.

Thanks for your fairness in the matter of the Lawrenson article. Yes, I should have howled earlier; my general policy is never to argue with anything written about me but your letter prompted an answer.

I shall be out of town for a few days but my address remains the same till April 25.





Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
