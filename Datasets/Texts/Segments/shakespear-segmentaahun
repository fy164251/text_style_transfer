OSWALD  Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou thus
to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor
knows thee!

thy heels and beat thee before the King? [He draws
his sword.] Draw, you rogue, for though it be night,
yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th' moonshine
of you, you whoreson, cullionly barbermonger.
Draw!

OSWALD  Away!
