aff]  I will run no base humor. Here, take
the humor-letter. I will keep the havior of
reputation.

FALSTAFF, [giving papers to Robin]
Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.--
Rogues, hence, avaunt, vanish like hailstones, go,
Trudge, plod away i' th' hoof, seek shelter, pack!
Falstaff will learn the humor of the age:
French thrift, you rogues--myself and skirted page.
