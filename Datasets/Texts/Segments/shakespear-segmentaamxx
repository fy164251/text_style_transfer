his fortunes thine.

VIOLA  I'll do my best
To woo your lady. [Aside.] Yet a barful strife!
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
[They exit.]

Scene 5
=======
[Enter Maria and Feste, the Fool.]


MARIA  Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I
will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter
in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy
absence.

FOOL  Let her hang me. He that is well hanged in this
world needs to fear no colors.

MARIA  Make that good.
