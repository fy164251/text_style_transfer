ed with the blood of men. Give me your aid,
And bend your spirits towards him.
[They go to Mars's altar, fall on
their faces before it, and then kneel.]
Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turned
Green Neptune into purple, whose approach
Comets prewarn, whose havoc in vast field
Unearthed skulls proclaim, whose breath blows

The teeming Ceres' foison, who dost pluck
With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds
The masoned turrets, that both mak'st and break'st
The stony girt
