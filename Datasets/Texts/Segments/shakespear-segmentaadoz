st thou behold Octavia?

MESSENGER
Ay, dread queen.

CLEOPATRA  Where?

MESSENGER  Madam, in Rome.
I looked her in the face and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.

CLEOPATRA
Is she as tall as me?

MESSENGER  She is not, madam.

CLEOPATRA
Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongued or low?

MESSENGER
Madam, I heard her speak. She is low-voiced.

CLEOPATRA
That's not so good. He cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN
Like her? O Isis, 'tis impossible!

CLEOPATRA
