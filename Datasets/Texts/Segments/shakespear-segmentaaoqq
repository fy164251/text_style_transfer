embrance is!--
My dear son Ferdinand.

PROSPERO  I am woe for 't, sir.

ALONSO
Irreparable is the loss, and patience
Says it is past her cure.

PROSPERO  I rather think
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace,
For the like loss, I have her sovereign aid
And rest myself content.

ALONSO  You the like loss?

PROSPERO
As great to me as late, and supportable
To make the dear loss have I means much weaker
Than you may call to comfort you, for I
Have lost my daughter.
