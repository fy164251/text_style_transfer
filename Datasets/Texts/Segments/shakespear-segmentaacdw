 cannon in a vault,
That mought not be distinguished, but at last
I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
"O, farewell, Warwick."

WARWICK
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves,
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
[He dies.]

OXFORD
Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!
[Here they bear away his body. They exit.]

Scene 3
=======
[Flourish. Enter King Edward in triumph, with Richard,
Clarence, and the rest, all wearing the white rose.]
