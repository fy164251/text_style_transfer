To take example by her.

EMILIA  Thou art wanton!

ARCITE, [to Palamon]
She is wondrous fair.

PALAMON  She is all the beauty extant.

EMILIA, [to Woman]
The sun grows high. Let's walk in. Keep these

I am wondrous merry-hearted. I could laugh now.

WOMAN
I could lie down, I am sure.

EMILIA  And take one with you?

WOMAN
That's as we bargain, madam.

EMILIA  Well, agree then.
