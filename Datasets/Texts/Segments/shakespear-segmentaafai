To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS  To a rope's end, sir, and to that
end am I returned.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, [beating Dromio]
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

OFFICER  Good sir, be patient.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS  Nay, 'tis for me to be patient. I am
in adversity.

OFFICER  Good now, hold thy tongue.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS  Nay, rather persuade him to hold
his hands.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS  Thou whoreson, senseless
villain.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
