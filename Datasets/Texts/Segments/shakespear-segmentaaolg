then take hands.
	Curtsied when you have, and kissed
	   The wild waves whist.
	Foot it featly here and there,
	   And sweet sprites bear
	The burden. Hark, hark!
	      [Burden dispersedly, within:] Bow-wow.
	   The watchdogs bark.
	      [Burden dispersedly, within:] Bow-wow.
	Hark, hark! I hear
	The strain of strutting chanticleer
	   Cry cock-a-diddle-dow.

Where should this music be? I' th' air, or th' earth?
It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon
Some god o' th
