t let you eat nor talk nor sleep,
And could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevailed on your condition,
I should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord,
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

BRUTUS
I am not well in health, and that is all.

PORTIA
Brutus is wise and, were he not in health,
He would embrace the means to come by it.

BRUTUS
Why so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.

PORTIA
Is Brutus sick? And is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
