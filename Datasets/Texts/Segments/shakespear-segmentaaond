bber, the boatswain, and I,
	   The gunner and his mate,
	Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,

	      Would cry to a sailor "Go hang!"
	She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch,
	Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch.
	      Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
This is a scurvy tune too. But here's my comfort.
