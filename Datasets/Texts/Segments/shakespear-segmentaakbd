OTHELLO
Dost thou mock me?

IAGO  I mock you not, by heaven!
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

OTHELLO
A horned man's a monster and a beast.

IAGO
There's many a beast, then, in a populous city,
And many a civil monster.

OTHELLO
Did he confess it?

IAGO  Good sir, be a man!
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
May draw with you. There's millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.
