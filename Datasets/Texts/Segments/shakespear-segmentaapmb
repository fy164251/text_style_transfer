easant, speedy,
The time is worth the use on 't.

CLEOMENES  Great Apollo
Turn all to th' best! These proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I little like.

DION  The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business when the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine sealed up,
Shall the contents discover. Something rare
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go. Fresh horses;
And gracious be the issue.
