ear,
Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
   That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with
   cheer?
      Come, tears, confound!
      Out, sword, and wound
   The pap of Pyramus;
      Ay, that left pap,
      Where heart doth hop.	[Pyramus stabs himself.]
   Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
      Now am I dead;
      Now am I fled;
   My soul is in the sky.
      Tongue, lose thy light!
      Moon, take thy flight!	[Moonshine exits.]
   Now die, die, die, die, die.
