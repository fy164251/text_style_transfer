WARWICK, [lying down]
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
I lay me down a little while to breathe,
For strokes received and many blows repaid
Have robbed my strong-knit sinews of their strength;
And spite of spite, needs must I rest awhile.

[Enter Edward, wearing the white rose, running.]


EDWARD
Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death,
For this world frowns and Edward's sun is clouded.

[Enter George, wearing the white rose.]
