 May we not see him?

HELICANUS  You may,
But bootless is your sight. He will not speak
To any.

LYSIMACHUS  Yet let me obtain my wish.

HELICANUS
Behold him. [Pericles is revealed.] This was a goodly
person,
Till the disaster that one mortal night
Drove him to this.

LYSIMACHUS
Sir king, all hail! The gods preserve you. Hail,
Royal sir!

HELICANUS
It is in vain; he will not speak to you.

LORD
Sir, we have a maid in Mytilene,
I durst wager would win some words of him.
