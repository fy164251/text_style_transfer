hronicles,
Say it did so a little time before
That our great-grandsire, Edward, sicked and died.

WARWICK
Speak lower, princes, for the King recovers.

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER
This apoplexy will certain be his end.

KING
I pray you take me up and bear me hence
Into some other chamber. Softly, pray.
[The King is carried to a bed on another
part of the stage.]
Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends,
Unless some dull and favorable hand
Will whisper music to my weary spirit.
