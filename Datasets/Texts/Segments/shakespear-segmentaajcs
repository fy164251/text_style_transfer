ts. What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft, how many months
Do you desire? [To Antonio.] Rest you fair, good
signior!
Your Worship was the last man in our mouths.

ANTONIO
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. [To Bassanio.] Is he yet
possessed
How much you would?

SHYLOCK  Ay, ay, three thousand
ducats.

ANTONIO  And for three months.
