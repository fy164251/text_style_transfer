 OF SYRACUSE
Master, there's a bark of Epidamium
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought
The oil, the balsamum, and aqua vitae.

Blows fair from land. They stay for naught at all
But for their owner, master, and yourself.
