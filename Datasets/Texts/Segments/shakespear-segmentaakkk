Leonine,
Take her by the arm. Walk with her.

MARINA  No,
I pray you, I'll not bereave you of your servant.

DIONYZA  Come, come.
I love the king your father and yourself
With more than foreign heart. We every day
Expect him here. When he shall come and find
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage,
Blame both my lord and me that we have taken
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
Walk, and be cheerful once again. Reserve
That
