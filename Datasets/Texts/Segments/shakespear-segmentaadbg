 JOHN  I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who
comes here?

[Enter Borachio.]

What news, Borachio?

BORACHIO  I came yonder from a great supper. The
Prince your brother is royally entertained by
Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an
intended marriage.

DON JOHN  Will it serve for any model to build mischief
on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
unquietness?

BORACHIO  Marry, it is your brother's right hand.

DON JOHN  Who, the most exquisite Claudio?
