ffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
   Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical--these summer flies
   Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.
I do forswear them, and I here protest
   By this white glove--how white the hand, God
   knows!--
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed
   In russet yeas and honest kersey noes.
And to begin: Wench, so God help me, law,
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

ROSALINE
Sans "sans," I pray you.
