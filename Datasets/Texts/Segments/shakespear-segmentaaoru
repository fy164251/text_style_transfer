she's kin to me, therefore she's not
so fair as Helen; an she were not kin to me, she
would be as fair o' Friday as Helen is on Sunday.
But what care I? I care not an she were a blackamoor;
'tis all one to me.

TROILUS  Say I she is not fair?

PANDARUS  I do not care whether you do or no. She's a
fool to stay behind her father. Let her to the Greeks,
and so I'll tell her the next time I see her. For my
part, I'll meddle nor make no more i' th' matter.
