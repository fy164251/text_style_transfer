 [to Andrew]  Pray, sir, put your sword up, if
you please.

ANDREW  Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised
you, I'll be as good as my word. He will bear you
easily, and reins well.

FIRST OFFICER  This is the man. Do thy office.

SECOND OFFICER  Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of
Count Orsino.

ANTONIO  You do mistake me, sir.

FIRST OFFICER
No, sir, no jot. I know your favor well,
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.--
Take him away. He knows I know him well.
