Since lecturing is for me a great strain, I believe that the present arrangement would hardly justify a trip to chilly Cambridge. I suggest therefore that we drop the lecture, and that I limit my activities to being around in London when LOLITA comes out.

Let me mention in passing that ordinarily I am a very expensive lecturer though I had agreed to disregard this point for once when I envisaged my Cambridge appearance as part of your campaign rather than as an educational venture.
