e from my son Coriolanus.
Guess but by my entertainment with him
if thou stand'st not i' th' state of hanging or of some
death more long in spectatorship and crueler in
suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for
what's to come upon thee. [(To Coriolanus.)] The
glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular
prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old
father Menenius does! O my son, my son! [(He
weeps.)] Thou art preparing fire for us; look thee,
here's water to quench it.
