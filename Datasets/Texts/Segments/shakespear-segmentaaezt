per, one that
countermands
The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot
well,
One that before the judgment carries poor souls to
hell.

ADRIANA  Why, man, what is the matter?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I do not know the matter. He is 'rested on the case.

ADRIANA
What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well,
But is in a suit of buff which 'rested him; that can I
tell.
