PANDER  Bolt!

BOLT  Sir?

PANDER  Search the market narrowly. Mytilene is full
of gallants. We lost too much money this mart by
being too wenchless.

BAWD  We were never so much out of creatures. We
have but poor three, and they can do no more than
they can do; and they with continual action are
even as good as rotten.

PANDER  Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we
pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be
used in every trade, we shall never prosper.
