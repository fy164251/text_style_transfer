ery. Is there any ships puts forth tonight? May
we be gone?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE  Why, sir, I brought you word an
hour since that the bark Expedition put forth tonight,
and then were you hindered by the sergeant
to tarry for the hoy Delay. Here are the angels that
you sent for to deliver you.	[He gives the purse.]

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
The fellow is distract, and so am I,
And here we wander in illusions.
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
