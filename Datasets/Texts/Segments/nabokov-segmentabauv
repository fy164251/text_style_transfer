 the inquiry. But I should only do this at the present time, if Holt would back me. Laughlin has now three books of mine: SEBASTIAN, the GOGOL book and LAUGHTER IN THE DARK which he bought from Bobbs-Merrill, the original publisher. THE THREE POETS contract has expired.

Has anything been done about the dust jacket for B.S.?1 I should like it to be as sober as possible.

And finally: you would very much oblige me if you now could have the second half of the advance sent to me.

Sincerely yours,
