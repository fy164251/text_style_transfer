 liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.

KING HENRY, [to Richmond]
Come hither, England's hope.
[Lays his hand on Richmond's head.]
If secret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a scepter, and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
Must help you more than you are hur
