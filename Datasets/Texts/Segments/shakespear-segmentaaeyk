love-springs rot?
   Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
   Then for her wealth's sake use her with more
   kindness.
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth --
   Muffle your false love with some show of
   blindness.
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
   Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
   Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger.
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted.
