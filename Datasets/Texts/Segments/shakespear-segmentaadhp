LEONATO
Hear you, my lords--

PRINCE  We have some haste,
Leonato.

LEONATO
Some haste, my lord! Well, fare you well, my lord.
Are you so hasty now? Well, all is one.

PRINCE
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.

LEONATO'S BROTHER
If he could right himself with quarrelling,
Some of us would lie low.

CLAUDIO  Who wrongs him?

LEONATO
Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou.
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword.
I fear thee not.
