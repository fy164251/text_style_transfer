hen I am resolved, I will not go.

JAILER
I must constrain you then; and, for you are
dangerous,
I'll clap more irons on you.

PALAMON  Do, good keeper.
I'll shake 'em so, you shall not sleep;
I'll make you a new morris. Must I go?

JAILER
There is no remedy.

PALAMON  Farewell, kind window.
May rude wind never hurt thee. O, my lady,
If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,
Dream how I suffer.--Come; now bury me.
