 character important and intensely patheticâ€”and new characters in literature are not born every day.

Throughout the years I worked at this book, I discarded many vistas that opened before me, abandoned many alluring but unnecessary sub-plots and generally pared my material to the bone, eliminating everything that was not strictly justified in the light of art. I am saying this in order to stress with absolute finality that I cannot tamper with either the plot or the construction of the thing.
