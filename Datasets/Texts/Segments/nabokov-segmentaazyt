THE VISIT TO THE MUSEUM


“The Visit to the Museum” (Poseshchenie muzeya) appeared in the émigré review Sovremennyya Zapiski, LXVIII, Paris, 1939, and in my collection Vesna v Fialte, Chekhov Publishing House, New York, 1959. The present English translation came out in Esquire, March 1963, and was included in Nabokov’s Quartet, Phaedra, New York, 1966.
