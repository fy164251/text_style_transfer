This heraldry in Lucrece' face was seen,
Argued by Beauty's red and Virtue's white.
Of either's color was the other queen,
Proving from world's minority their right.
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight,
  The sovereignty of either being so great
  That oft they interchange each other's seat.

This silent war of lilies and of roses,
Which Tarquin viewed in her fair face's field,
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses,
Where, lest between them both it should be killed,
