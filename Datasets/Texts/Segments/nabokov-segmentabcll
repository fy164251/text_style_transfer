 account of the Girodias business as far as it goes down that page.1 Ergaz did not "refer" me to him: she handled the matter alone. Nabokov did not "seem" not to know etc., he simply did not know anything at all, not having been in Europe since 1940. No illustrations were ever contemplated. For obvious reasons (Girodias having his own several versions) perfect exactitude is essential for me in this affair. You will find an exact record of it in my "Lolita and Mr. Girodias" (Evergreen, Feb. 1967)
