ing Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love,
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
[Post blowing a horn within.]

KING LEWIS
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

[Enter the Post.]


POST [speaks to Warwick.]
My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague.
[(To Lewis.)] These from our king unto your Majesty.
[(To Margaret.)] And, madam, these for you--from
whom, I know not.	[They all read their letters.]
