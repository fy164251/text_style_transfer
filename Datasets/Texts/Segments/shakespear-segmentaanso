is and my food are equals. There's no odds.
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.

Apemantus' grace.

	Immortal gods, I crave no pelf.
	I pray for no man but myself.
	Grant I may never prove so fond
	To trust man on his oath or bond,
	Or a harlot for her weeping,
	Or a dog that seems a-sleeping,
	Or a keeper with my freedom,
	Or my friends if I should need 'em.
	Amen. So fall to 't.
	Rich men sin, and I eat root.
[He eats and drinks.]
Much good dich thy good heart, Ape
