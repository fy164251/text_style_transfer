For as we know from dreams it is so hard

590 To speak to our dear dead! They disregard

Our apprehension, queaziness and shame—

The awful sense that they’re not quite the same.

And our school chum killed in a distant war

Is not surprised to see us at his door,

And in a blend of jauntiness and gloom

Points at the puddles in his basement room.



But who can teach the thoughts we should roll-call

When morning finds us marching to the wall

Under the stage direction of some goon
