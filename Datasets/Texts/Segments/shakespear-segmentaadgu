Signior Leonato, let the Friar advise you.
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio,
Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body.

LEONATO  Being that I flow in grief,
The smallest twine may lead me.

FRIAR
'Tis well consented. Presently away,
   For to strange sores strangely they strain the
   cure.--
Come, lady, die to live.
