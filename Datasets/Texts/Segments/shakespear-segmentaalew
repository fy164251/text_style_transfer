With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do
With some men else that think themselves as safe
As thou and I, who, as thou know'st, are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.

The Princes both make high account of you--
[Aside.] For they account his head upon the Bridge.

HASTINGS

[Enter Lord Stanley.]

Come on, come on. Where is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the boar and go so unprovided?

STANLEY
My lord, good morrow.
