im. If it be honest you
have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am
bound to call upon you, and, I pray you, your name?

LUCIO  Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.

DUKE, [as Friar]  He shall know you better, sir, if I may
live to report you.

LUCIO  I fear you not.

DUKE, [as Friar]  O, you hope the Duke will return no
more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.
But indeed I can do you little harm; you'll
forswear this again.

LUCIO  I'll be hanged first.
