d, ply her hard.--
Come, sister.--Shepherdess, look on him better,
And be not proud. Though all the world could see,
None could be so abused in sight as he.--
Come, to our flock.
[She exits, with Celia and Corin.]

PHOEBE, [aside]
Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
"Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?"

SILVIUS
Sweet Phoebe--

PHOEBE  Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?

SILVIUS  Sweet Phoebe, pity me.

PHOEBE
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

SILVIUS
