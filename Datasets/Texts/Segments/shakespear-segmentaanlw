 with a derry,
	And a derry and a down,
	Say the Schoolmaster's no clown.--
	Duke, if we have pleased thee too
	And have done as good boys should do,
	Give us but a tree or twain
	For a Maypole, and again,
	Ere another year run out,
	We'll make thee laugh, and all this rout.

THESEUS
Take twenty, Domine.--How does my sweetheart?

HIPPOLYTA
Never so pleased, sir.

EMILIA  'Twas an excellent dance,
And, for a preface, I never heard a better.

THESEUS
Schoolmaster, I thank you.-
