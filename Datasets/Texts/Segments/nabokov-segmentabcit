n,

My husband asks me to thank you for your interesting letter of Feb. 22, and also to answer it. The questions you raise are very painful and complicated. The people you write about risk very much in seeking even indirect contact with VN. But VN cannot even be sure that what they stand for is true freedom as we know it in the West, and not merely a different brand of communism (as did, f.i., Pasternak in his dreadful ZHIVAGOâ€”so highly praised by naive libertarians in and out of Russia).
