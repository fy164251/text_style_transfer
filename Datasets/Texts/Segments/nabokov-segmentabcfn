 Chapter 6 should not be cut. He would like you to include it in its entirety, possibly instead of "Mademoiselle" (which you are listing under Short Stories, and of which more below)

Essays and Criticism: Chichikov (yes, but there are some indispensable revisions that V.N. would make); "On a Book entitled LOLITA" (yes); "Foreword to BEND SINISTER" (yes).

V.N. is against the inclusion of "Problems of Translation" and "Art of Translation".
