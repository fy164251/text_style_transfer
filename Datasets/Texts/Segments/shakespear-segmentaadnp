 'greed upon,
To part with unhacked edges and bear back
Our targes undinted.

ALL  That's our offer.

POMPEY  Know then
I came before you here a man prepared
To take this offer. But Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience.--Though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly.

ANTONY  I have heard it, Pompey,
And am well studied for a liberal thanks,
Which I do owe you.
