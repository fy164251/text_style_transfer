A friend? What friend? Your name, I pray you,

STEPHANO
Stephano is my name, and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours.

LORENZO  Who comes with her?

STEPHANO

I pray you, is my master yet returned?

LORENZO

But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
And ceremoniously
