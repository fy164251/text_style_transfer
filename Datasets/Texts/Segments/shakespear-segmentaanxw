contrary.
There's a medlar for thee. Eat it.

TIMON  On what I hate I feed not.

APEMANTUS  Dost hate a medlar?

TIMON  Ay, though it look like thee.

APEMANTUS  An thou 'dst hated meddlers sooner, thou
shouldst have loved thyself better now. What man
didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved
after his means?

TIMON  Who, without those means thou talk'st of, didst
thou ever know beloved?

APEMANTUS  Myself.

TIMON  I understand thee. Thou hadst some means to
keep a dog.
