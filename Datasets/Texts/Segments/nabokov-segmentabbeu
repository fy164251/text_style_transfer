interested in any of these works, I shall explain in more detail what is wrong with the old translations (for instance, with Yarmolinski's "The Pistol Shot or Guerney's "The Queen of Spades").

My protege is none other than my son who will be graduated from Harvard this spring. He is a young Russian scholar and a budding American author in his own right. He has done some very creditable translations for me, and I would undertake to control and revise and work on the lines suggested here.
