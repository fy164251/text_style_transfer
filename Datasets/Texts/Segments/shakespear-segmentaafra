 cardinal.
You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord.
You are a churchman, or I'll tell you, cardinal,

WOLSEY  I am glad
Your Grace is grown so pleasant.

KING  My Lord Chamberlain,
Prithee come hither. What fair lady's that?

CHAMBERLAIN
An 't please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter,
The Viscount Rochford, one of her Highness' women.

KING
By heaven, she is a dainty one.--Sweetheart,
I were unmannerly to take you out
And not to kiss you
