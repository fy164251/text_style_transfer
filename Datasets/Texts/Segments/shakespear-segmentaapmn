yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge.

[Enter Cleomenes, Dion, with Officers.]


OFFICER, [presenting a sword]
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have
brought
This sealed-up oracle, by the hand delivered
Of great Apollo's priest, and that since then
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secrets in 't.

CLEOMENES, DION  All this we swear.

LEONTES  Break up the seals and read.
