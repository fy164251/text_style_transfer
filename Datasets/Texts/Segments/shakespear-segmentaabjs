KING HENRY
What mean'st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are
these?

SUFFOLK
Please it your Majesty, this is the man
That doth accuse his master of high treason.
His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,
Was rightful heir unto the English crown,
And that your Majesty was an usurper.

KING HENRY  Say, man, were these thy words?

HORNER  An 't shall please your Majesty, I never said
nor thought any such matter. God is my witness, I
am falsely accused by the villain.

PETER  B
