ut of
service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible on
such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking
with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

ROSALIND  The Duke my father loved his father dearly.

CELIA  Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his
son dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him,
for my father hated his father dearly. Yet I hate not
Orlando.

ROSALIND  No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

CELIA  Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
