BERTRAM
My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your Highness
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes.

KING  Know'st thou not,
Bertram,
What she has done for me?

BERTRAM  Yes, my good lord,
But never hope to know why I should marry her.

KING

BERTRAM

Must answer for your raising? I know her well;
She had her breeding at my father's charge.
