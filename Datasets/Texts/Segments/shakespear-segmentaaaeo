PRINCE  Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's

PETO  Why, he hacked it with his dagger and said he
would swear truth out of England but he would

us to do the like.

BARDOLPH  Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass
to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our
garments with it, and swear it was the blood of true
men.
