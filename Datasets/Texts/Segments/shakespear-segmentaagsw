ere;
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Caesar's death.

FIRST PLEBEIAN  I will hear Brutus speak.

SECOND PLEBEIAN
I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons
When severally we hear them rendered.
[Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians.
Brutus goes into the pulpit.]

THIRD PLEBEIAN
The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence.

BRUTUS  Be patient till the last.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my
cause, and be silent
