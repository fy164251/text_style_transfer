posite bank;

through the mist the stream of its emeralds running;

all the things that already I cannot express.

In a moment we’ll pass across the world’s threshold

into a region—name it as you please:

wilderness, death, disavowal of language,

or maybe simpler: the silence of love;

the silence of a distant cartway, its furrow,

beneath the foam of flowers concealed;

my silent country (the love that is hopeless);

the silent sheet lightning, the silent seed.
