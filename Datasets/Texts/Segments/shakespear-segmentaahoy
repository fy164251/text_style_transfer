 the Princess I did give.
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.

PRINCESS
Pardon me, sir. This jewel did she wear.
[She points to Rosaline.]
And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.
[To Berowne.] What, will you have me, or your pearl
again?	[She shows the token.]

BEROWNE
Neither of either. I remit both twain.
I see the trick on 't. Here was a consent,
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy.
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight
zany,
