JAILER
And, madam, I must be present at your conference.

PAULINA  Well, be 't so, prithee.	[Jailer exits.]

Dear gentlewoman,

As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together. On her frights and griefs,
Which never tender lady hath borne greater,
She is something before her time delivered.
