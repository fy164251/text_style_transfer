 you have it.

SURREY  Now, all my joy
Trace the conjunction!

SUFFOLK  My amen to 't.

NORFOLK  All men's.

SUFFOLK
There's order given for her coronation.
Marry, this is yet but young and may be left
To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
She is a gallant creature and complete
In mind and feature. I persuade me, from her
Will fall some blessing to this land which shall
In it be memorized.

SURREY  But will the King
Digest this letter of the Cardinal's?
The Lord forbid!
