 In your issue of February 25â€“26, 1961, Mr. Thomas Quinn Curtiss quotes a passage from what he calls "the best to my knowledge" translation of "Uncle Vanya" in English (by Rose Caylor). Does his knowledge include some familiarity with the original text? I am asking this because one of the glaring errors in that passage is the corny "We shall see Heaven in all its radiant glory" instead of the literal "We shall see the whole sky bediamonded" or, paraphrased, "ablaze with stars".
