Scene 4
=======
[Enter the Empress' sons, Demetrius and Chiron,
with Lavinia, her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out,
and ravished.]


DEMETRIUS
So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravished thee.

CHIRON
Write down thy mind; bewray thy meaning so,
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.

DEMETRIUS
See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.

CHIRON, [to Lavinia]
Go home. Call for sweet water; wash thy hands.
