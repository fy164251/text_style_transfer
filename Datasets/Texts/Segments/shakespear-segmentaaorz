efore the sun rose he was harnessed light,
And to the field goes he, where every flower
Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
In Hector's wrath.

CRESSIDA  What was his cause of anger?

ALEXANDER
The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector.
They call him Ajax.

CRESSIDA  Good; and what of him?

ALEXANDER
They say he is a very man per se
And stands alone.

CRESSIDA  So do all men unless they are drunk, sick,
or have no legs.

ALEXA
