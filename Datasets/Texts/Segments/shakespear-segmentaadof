 [aside to Pompey]
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

POMPEY  What sayst thou?

MENAS
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

POMPEY  How should that be?

MENAS  But entertain it,
And though thou think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world.

POMPEY  Hast thou drunk well?

MENAS
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove.
Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
Is thine, if thou wilt ha 't.
