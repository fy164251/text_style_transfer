I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and
dwarfish!--
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou looked'st on majesty.

MESSENGER  She creeps.
Her motion and her station are as one.
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.

CLEOPATRA  Is this certain?

MESSENGER
Or I have no observance.

CHARMIAN  Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA  He's very knowing.
I do perceive 't. There's nothing in her yet.
The fellow has good judgment.
