, said Bel, she had loved it. Especially the path down, down tothe sea and the aroma of rosemary (chudnyy zapakh rozmarina). I was torturedand charmed by her "shadowless" émigré Russian, untainted, God blessAnnette, by the Langley woman's fruity Sovietisms.

"I recognize your hands and your hair."

"On se tutoie in Russian henceforward. All right. Let's go upstairs."

She approved of the studio: "A schoolroom in a picture book."
