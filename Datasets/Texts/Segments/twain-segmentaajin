 you dear women live right in the present all the
time--but a man, why a man lives----

â€œIn the future, Beriah? But don't we live in the future most too much,
Beriah? We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year's crop of corn
and potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along,
but sometimes it's not a robust diet,--Beriah. But don't look that
way, dear--don't mind what I say. I don't mean to fret, I don't mean to
worry; and I don't, once a month, do I, dear?
