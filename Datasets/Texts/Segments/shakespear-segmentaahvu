AR
Who put my man i' th' stocks?

CORNWALL  What trumpet's that?

REGAN
I know 't--my sister's. This approves her letter,
That she would soon be here.

[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]

Is your lady come?

LEAR
This is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.--
Out, varlet, from my sight!

CORNWALL  What means your Grace?

LEAR
Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope
Thou didst not know on 't.

[Enter Goneril.]

Who comes here?
