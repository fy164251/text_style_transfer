
[Enter a Gardener and two Servingmen.]

But stay, here come the gardeners.
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
They will talk of state, for everyone doth so
Against a change. Woe is forerun with woe.
[Queen and Ladies step aside.]

GARDENER, [to one Servingman]
Go, bind thou up young dangling apricokes
Which, like unruly children, make their sire
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight.
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.--
