CANUS  Sir.

PERICLES
My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
The inhospitable Cleon, but I am
For other service first. Toward Ephesus
Turn our blown sails. Eftsoons I'll tell thee why.--
Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
And give you gold for such provision
As our intents will need?

LYSIMACHUS  Sir,
With all my heart. And when you come ashore,
I have another suit.

PERICLES  You shall prevail
Were it to woo my daughter, for it seems
You have been noble towards her.
