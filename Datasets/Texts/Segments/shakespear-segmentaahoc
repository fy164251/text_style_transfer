ERINE
O, for your reason! Quickly, sir, I long.

LONGAVILLE
You have a double tongue within your mask,
And would afford my speechless vizard half.

KATHERINE
Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not veal a calf?

LONGAVILLE
A calf, fair lady?

KATHERINE  No, a fair Lord Calf.

LONGAVILLE
Let's part the word.

KATHERINE  No, I'll not be your half.
Take all and wean it. It may prove an ox.

LONGAVILLE
Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks.
Will you give horns, chaste lady?
