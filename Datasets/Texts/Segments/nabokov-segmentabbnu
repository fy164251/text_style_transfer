erested in publishing LOLITA in this country. I certainly am interested and wrote back to him to that effect, suggesting that we make an arrangement whereby I would pay you a royalty of 7V2 per cent on the first 10,000 copies and 10 per cent thereafter. A separate royalty of 5 per cent would go to M. Girodias."

Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
