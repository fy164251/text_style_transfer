It is a business of some heat. The galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels,
And many of the Consuls, raised and met,
Are at the Duke's already. You have been hotly
called for.
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The Senate hath sent about three several quests
To search you out.

OTHELLO  'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house
And go with you.	[He exits.]

CASSIO  Ancient, what makes he here?
