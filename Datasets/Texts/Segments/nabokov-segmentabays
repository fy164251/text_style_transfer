ted States" book. I am not going to write it at all unless you are interested.

The article about Pavlov1 is vividly written but the author does not seem to be aware that Pavlov was after all a crank, that most of the results of his experiments might have been clear a priori, and that the whole matter has been severely and deservedly criticized by leading scientists abroad.

On the other hand, Rebecca West's piece2 is admirable and I am eagerly waiting for its continuation.

Sincerely yours,
