!--Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS
Lay hands upon him!

MENENIUS  Help Martius, help!
You that be noble, help him, young and old!

ALL PLEBEIANS  Down with him, down with him!

[In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the Aediles, and the People
are beat in.]


MENENIUS, [to Coriolanus]
Go, get you to your house. Begone, away.
All will be naught else.

SECOND SENATOR  Get you gone.

CORIOLANUS  Stand fast!
We have as many friends as enemies.

MENENIUS
Shall it be put to that?
