 on many toes.

I am giving you the names of three Russian scholars well qualified to examine the book. My personal contacts with them have been very limited, but I know them to be honest scholars. I am definitely op posed to the book's going to anybody connected with either Columbia or Harvard. I must have your assurance that, should you desire to have the book read by anyone (outside of your office) other than the persons I mentioned, you will discuss your choice with me.
