a French label on it, and then they buy it.”
 I have heard that the most of the French-labeled claret in New York is
made in California.  And I remember what Professor S. told me once about
Veuve Cliquot--if that was the wine, and I think it was.  He was the
guest of a great wine merchant whose town was quite near that vineyard,
and this merchant asked him if very much V. C. was drunk in America.

“Oh, yes,” said S., “a great abundance of it.”

“Is it easy to be had?”
