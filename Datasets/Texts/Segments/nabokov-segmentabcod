Tourtour, Var, France





31 May 1971

I, too, embrace my dear and also unique one. I walk a great deal here and write a great deal. The afternoons are always gloomy. Five stories have already been placed in magazines but the royalties will not go for boats of any kind!1 The Tourtour food is very rich.





I send you a kiss
