rst, good company, good wine, good welcome
Can make good people.

[Enter Lord Chamberlain, Lord Sands, and
Sir Thomas Lovell.]

O, my lord, you're tardy!
The very thought of this fair company
Clapped wings to me.

CHAMBERLAIN  You are young, Sir Harry Guilford.

SANDS
Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal
But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
Should find a running banquet, ere they rested,
I think would better please 'em. By my life,
They are a sweet society of fair ones.
