ere have killed your king, I do forgive thee,
Unnatural though thou art.--Their understanding
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
That yet looks on me or would know me.--Ariel,
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.
[Ariel exits and at once returns
with Prospero's ducal robes.]
I will discase me and myself present
As I was sometime Milan.--Quickly, spirit,
Thou shalt ere long be free.

ARIEL
