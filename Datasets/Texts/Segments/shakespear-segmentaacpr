s himself,
Though yet he never harmed me, here I quit him.
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,
And at that time he got his wife with child.
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick.
And now behold the meaning.

[Enter Helen and Widow.]


KING  Is there no exorcist
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
Is 't real that I see?

HELEN  No, my good lord,
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
The name and not the thing.
