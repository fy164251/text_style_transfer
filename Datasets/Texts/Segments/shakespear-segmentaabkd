A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
[Buckingham hands him the papers.]

[(Reads.)] The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose,
But him outlive and die a violent death.

Romanos vincere posse. Well, to the rest:
[(Reads.)] Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of
Suffolk?
By water shall he die and take his end.
What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
Let him shun castles;
