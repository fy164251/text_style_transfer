BENEDICK  First, of my word! Therefore play, music.--
Prince, thou art sad. Get thee a wife, get thee a wife.
There is no staff more reverend than one tipped
with horn.

MESSENGER, [to Prince]
My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
And brought with armed men back to Messina.

BENEDICK, [to Prince]  Think not on him till tomorrow.
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.--Strike
up, pipers!	[Music plays. They dance.]
[They exit.]
