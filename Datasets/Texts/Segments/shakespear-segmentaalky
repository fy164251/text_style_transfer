
Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf.
King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
[He exits.]

[Enter the Ghost of Henry the Sixth.]


GHOST OF HENRY, [to Richard]
When I was mortal, my anointed body
By thee was punched full of deadly holes.

Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
[(To Richmond.)] Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror.
Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,
Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish
