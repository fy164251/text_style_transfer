 was in love with my bed. I thank you,
you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
bolder to chide you for yours.

VALENTINE  In conclusion, I stand affected to her.

SPEED  I would you were set, so your affection would
cease.

VALENTINE  Last night she enjoined me to write some
lines to one she loves.

SPEED  And have you?

VALENTINE  I have.

SPEED  Are they not lamely writ?

VALENTINE  No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
Peace, here she comes.
