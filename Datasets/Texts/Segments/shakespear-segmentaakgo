iard from Antiochus is welcome.

THALIARD  From him I come with message unto princely
Pericles, but since my landing I have understood
your lord has betook himself to unknown travels.

HELICANUS  We have no reason to desire it,
Commended to our master, not to us.
Yet ere you shall depart, this we desire:
As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.
