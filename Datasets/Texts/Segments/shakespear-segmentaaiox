LUCIO  No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the
wear. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage.
If you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is
the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.--Bless you, friar.

DUKE, [as Friar]  And you.

LUCIO, [to Pompey]  Does Bridget paint still, Pompey,
ha?

ELBOW, [to Pompey]  Come your ways, sir, come.

POMPEY, [to Lucio]  You will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO  Then, Pompey, nor now.--What news abroad,
friar? What news?
