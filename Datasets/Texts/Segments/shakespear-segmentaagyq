QUEEN ELEANOR
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and Earth!

CONSTANCE
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and Earth,
Call not me slanderer. Thou and thine usurp
The dominations, royalties, and rights
Of this oppressed boy. This is thy eldest son's son,
Infortunate in nothing but in thee.
Thy sins are visited in this poor child.
The canon of the law is laid on him,
Being but the second generation
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.
