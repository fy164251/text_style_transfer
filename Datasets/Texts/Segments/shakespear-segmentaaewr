 didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his
mind?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

LUCIANA  Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel
his meaning?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS  Nay, he struck so plainly I could
too well feel his blows, and withal so doubtfully
that I could scarce understand them.

ADRIANA
But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
