hat I have from the loving king.
[She shows a jewel.]

ROSALINE
Madam, came nothing else along with that?

PRINCESS
Nothing but this? Yes, as much love in rhyme
As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

ROSALINE
That was the way to make his godhead wax,
For he hath been five thousand year a boy.

KATHERINE
Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows, too.

ROSALINE
You'll ne'er be friends with him.
