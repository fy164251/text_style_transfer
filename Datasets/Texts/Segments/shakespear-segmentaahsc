honor and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience.
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath
writ this to feel my affection to your Honor, and to

auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that
without any further delay than this very evening.

GLOUCESTER  He cannot be such a monster.
