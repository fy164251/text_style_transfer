 my sovereign lord.

RICHARD
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

TYRREL
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
For it is done.

RICHARD  But did'st thou see them dead?

TYRREL
I did, my lord.

RICHARD  And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

TYRREL
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them,
But where, to say the truth, I do not know.

RICHARD
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after-supper,
When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
