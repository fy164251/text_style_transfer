n excellent piece.

POET  I must serve him so too--tell him of an intent
that's coming toward him.

PAINTER  Good as the best. Promising is the very air o'
th' time; it opens the eyes of expectation. Performance
is ever the duller for his act, and but in the
plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying
is quite out of use. To promise is most courtly
and fashionable. Performance is a kind of will or
testament which argues a great sickness in his
judgment that makes it.
