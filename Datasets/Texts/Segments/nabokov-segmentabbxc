We are leaving here on Wednesday, 12 October, for New York, where we shall stay at the Hampshire House Hotel, Central Park South. On 2 November we shall sail on the Queen Elizabeth for Cherbourg. From there we shall head for Geneva, and arrive on Tuesday, 8 November. You please come there too.

Your recordings will probably be completed by then. Arrange your schedule so as to arrive on Tuesday or, if that is impossible, at the end of the week, for as many days as you can
