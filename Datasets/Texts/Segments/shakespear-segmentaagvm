Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

LUCIUS
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

BRUTUS
Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?

LUCIUS  Nothing, my lord.

BRUTUS
Sleep again, Lucius.--Sirrah Claudius!
[To Varro.] Fellow thou, awake!	[They rise up.]

VARRO  My lord?

CLAUDIUS  My lord?

BRUTUS
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

BOTH
Did we, my lord?

BRUTUS  Ay. Saw you anything?

VARRO  No, my lord, I saw nothing.
