EDMUND
Well thought on. Take my sword. Give it the
Captain.

EDGAR, [to a Soldier]  Haste thee for thy life.
[The Soldier exits with Edmund's sword.]

EDMUND, [to Albany]
He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
To lay the blame upon her own despair,
That she fordid herself.

ALBANY
The gods defend her!--Bear him hence awhile.
[Edmund is carried off.]

[Enter Lear with Cordelia in his arms,
followed by a Gentleman.]
