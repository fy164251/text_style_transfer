Dear Jason,

First of all let me thank you, or not thank you, for Harry Matthews' THE CONVERSIONS. It is a shapeless little heap of pretentious nonsense. When I used to teach Creative Writing, there would always be at least one student who would reel out this kind of automatic stuff. Sorry.

Vera and I look very much forward to seeing you and Barbara in your high-ceile
