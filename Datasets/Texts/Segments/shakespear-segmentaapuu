FALSTAFF  Mine Host of the Garter!

HOST  What says my bullyrook? Speak scholarly and
wisely.

FALSTAFF  Truly, mine Host, I must turn away some of
my followers.

HOST  Discard, bully Hercules, cashier. Let them wag;
trot, trot.

FALSTAFF  I sit at ten pounds a week.

HOST  Thou 'rt an emperor--Caesar, Keiser, and
Pheazar. I will entertain Bardolph. He shall draw,
he shall tap. Said I well, bully Hector?

FALSTAFF  Do so, good mine Host.

HOST  I have spoke.
