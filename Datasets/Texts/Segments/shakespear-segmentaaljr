RICHARD
Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Shall I forget myself to be myself?

RICHARD
Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong yourself.

QUEEN ELIZABETH  Yet thou didst kill my children.

RICHARD
But in your daughter's womb I bury them,
Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

RICHARD
And be a happy mother by the deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH  I go. Writ
