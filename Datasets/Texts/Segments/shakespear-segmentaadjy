e Soothsayer]  Good sir,

SOOTHSAYER  I make not, but foresee.

CHARMIAN  Pray then, foresee me one.

SOOTHSAYER
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

CHARMIAN  He means in flesh.

IRAS  No, you shall paint when you are old.

CHARMIAN  Wrinkles forbid!

ALEXAS  Vex not his prescience. Be attentive.

CHARMIAN  Hush.

SOOTHSAYER
You shall be more beloving than beloved.

CHARMIAN  I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

ALEXAS  Nay, hear him.
