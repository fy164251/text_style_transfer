 I could.--Tomorrow
meet me all together. [(To Phoebe.)] I will marry
you if ever I marry woman, and I'll be married
tomorrow. [(To Orlando.)] I will satisfy you if ever I
satisfy man, and you shall be married tomorrow.
[(To Silvius.)] I will content you, if what pleases you
contents you, and you shall be married tomorrow.
[(To Orlando.)] As you love Rosalind, meet. [(To
Silvius.)] As you love Phoebe, meet.--And as I love
no woman, I'll meet. So fare you well. I have left
you commands.
