ch nativity!

DUKE
With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast.
[All exit except the two Dromios
and the two brothers Antipholus.]

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, [to Antipholus of Ephesus]
Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, [to Antipholus of Ephesus]
He speaks to me.--I am your master, Dromio.
Come, go with us.
