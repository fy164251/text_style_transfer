Judas I am--

DUMAINE  The more shame for you, Judas.

HOLOFERNES  What mean you, sir?

BOYET  To make Judas hang himself.

HOLOFERNES  Begin, sir, you are my elder.

BEROWNE  Well followed. Judas was hanged on an
elder.

HOLOFERNES  I will not be put out of countenance.

BEROWNE  Because thou hast no face.

HOLOFERNES  What is this?	[He points to his own face.]

BOYET  A cittern-head.

DUMAINE  The head of a bodkin.
