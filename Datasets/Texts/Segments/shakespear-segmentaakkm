Is this wind westerly that blows?

LEONINE  Southwest.

MARINA
When I was born, the wind was north.

LEONINE  Was 't so?

MARINA
My father, as nurse says, did never fear,
But cried "Good seamen!" to the sailors,
Galling his kingly hands haling ropes,
And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
That almost burst the deck.

LEONINE  When was this?

MARINA  When I was born.
Never was waves nor wind more violent,
And from the ladder-tackle washes off
A canvas-climber. "Ha!"
