ar so much.

VALENTINE  My friends--

FIRST OUTLAW
That's not so, sir. We are your enemies.

SECOND OUTLAW  Peace. We'll hear him.

THIRD OUTLAW
Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man.

VALENTINE
Then know that I have little wealth to lose.
A man I am crossed with adversity;
My riches are these poor habiliments,
Of which, if you should here disfurnish me,
You take the sum and substance that I have.

SECOND OUTLAW  Whither travel you?

VALENTINE  To Verona.
