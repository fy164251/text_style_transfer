t eat me?

COUNTRYMAN  You must not think I am so simple but
I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I
know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil
dress her not. But truly these same whoreson devils
do the gods great harm in their women, for in every
ten that they make, the devils mar five.

CLEOPATRA  Well, get thee gone. Farewell.

COUNTRYMAN  Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o' th'
worm.	[He exits.]
