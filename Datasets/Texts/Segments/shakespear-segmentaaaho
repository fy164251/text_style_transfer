ESS  Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or
any man knows where to have me, thou knave,
thou.

PRINCE  Thou sayst true, hostess, and he slanders thee
most grossly.

HOSTESS  So he doth you, my lord, and said this other
day you owed him a thousand pound.

PRINCE  Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?

FALSTAFF  A thousand pound, Hal? A million. Thy love is
worth a million; thou owest me thy love.

HOSTESS  Nay, my lord, he called you "jack," and said
he would cudgel you.
