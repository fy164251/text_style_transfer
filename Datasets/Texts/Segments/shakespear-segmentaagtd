 Brutus here.

FIRST PLEBEIAN
This Caesar was a tyrant.

THIRD PLEBEIAN  Nay, that's certain.
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.

SECOND PLEBEIAN
Peace, let us hear what Antony can say.

ANTONY
You gentle Romans--

PLEBEIANS  Peace, ho! Let us hear him.

ANTONY
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones.
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
