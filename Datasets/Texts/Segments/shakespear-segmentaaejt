Let him be so entertained
amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your knowing,
to a stranger of his quality.--I beseech you all,
be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend
to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy
he is I will leave to appear hereafter rather
than story him in his own hearing.

FRENCHMAN, [to Posthumus]  Sir, we have known together
in Orleans.

POSTHUMUS  Since when I have been debtor to you for
courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay
still.
