till we have hewn thee down
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD
And in this resolution, I defy thee,
Not willing any longer conference,
Since thou denied'st the gentle king to speak.--
Sound, trumpets! Let our bloody colors wave;
And either victory or else a grave!

QUEEN MARGARET  Stay, Edward!

EDWARD
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay.
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
[They all exit.]
