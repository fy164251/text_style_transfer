s Athenian swain,
That he, awaking when the other do,
May all to Athens back again repair
And think no more of this night's accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the Fairy Queen.
[He applies the nectar to her eyes.]
	Be as thou wast wont to be.
	See as thou wast wont to see.
	Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
	Hath such force and blessed power.
Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.

TITANIA, [waking]
My Oberon, what visions have I seen!
