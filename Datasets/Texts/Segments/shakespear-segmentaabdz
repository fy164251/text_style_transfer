
COLEVILE  It is, my lord.

JOHN OF LANCASTER  A famous rebel art thou,
Colevile.

FALSTAFF  And a famous true subject took him.

COLEVILE
I am, my lord, but as my betters are
That led me hither. Had they been ruled by me,
You should have won them dearer than you have.

FALSTAFF  I know not how they sold themselves, but
thou, like a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis,
and I thank thee for thee.

[Enter Westmoreland.]


JOHN OF LANCASTER  Now, have you left pursuit?
