  Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
But let it be; I am quickly ill and well;
So Antony loves.

ANTONY  My precious queen, forbear,
And give true evidence to his love, which stands
An honorable trial.

CLEOPATRA  So Fulvia told me.
I prithee turn aside and weep for her,
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
Like perfect honor.

ANTONY  You'll heat my blood. No more!

CLEOPATRA
You can do better yet
