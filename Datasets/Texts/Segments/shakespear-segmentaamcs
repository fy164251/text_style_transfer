nto my clothes.
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you
When I should bid good morrow to my bride
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.

I'll after him, and see the event of this.
