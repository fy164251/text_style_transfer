time
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
So many folds of favor. Sure her offense
Must be of such unnatural degree
That monsters it, or your forevouched affection
Fall into taint; which to believe of her
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Should never plant in me.

CORDELIA, [to Lear]  I yet beseech your Majesty--
If for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose not, since what I well
intend
I'll do 't before I speak--that you make known
It is no vicious blot
