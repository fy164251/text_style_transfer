CLARENCE
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
[He removes the red rose.]
Look, here I throw my infamy at thee.
[He throws the rose at Warwick.]
I will not ruinate my father's house,
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together

To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath.
To keep that oath
