hard,
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

PHOEBE
I would not be thy executioner.
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.

That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
Who shut their coward gate
