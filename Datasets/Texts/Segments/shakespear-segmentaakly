 sty, where, since I came,
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic--
That the gods
Would set me free from this unhallowed place,
Though they did change me to the meanest bird
That flies i' the purer air!

LYSIMACHUS  I did not think
Thou couldst have spoke so well, ne'er dreamt thou
couldst.
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,
Thy speech had altered it. Hold, here's gold for thee.
Persevere in that clear way thou goest
And the gods strengthen thee!	[He gives her money.]
