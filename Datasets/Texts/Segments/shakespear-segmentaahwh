Scene 1
=======
[Storm still. Enter Kent in disguise, and a Gentleman,
severally.]


KENT  Who's there, besides foul weather?

GENTLEMAN
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

KENT  I know you. Where's the King?

GENTLEMAN
Contending with the fretful elements;
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea
Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,
That things might change or cease; tears his white
hair,
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
Catch in their fury
