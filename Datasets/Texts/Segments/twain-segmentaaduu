“They are simple. Let the men rest three hours longer. At one o'clock
the advance-guard will march, under our command, with Pothon of

that you avoid an engagement. I will ride under guard to Beaugency and
make so quick work there that I and the Constable of France will join
you before dawn with his men.”
