rd the MS to you.

For reasons you will easily understand after reading the book, I would wish to publish it under a penname. And for the same reasons, I would like to ask you to do me the favor of reading it yourself and not having it read by anyone else unless, after you have read it, you come to the conclusion that you wish to consider its publication.

I hope I may hear soon from you.





Yours truly,

Vladimir Nabokov
