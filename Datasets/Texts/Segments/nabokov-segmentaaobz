ened to please me (a footnote from Boswell’s Life of Dr. Johnson, the inscriptions on the trees in Word-smith’s famous avenue, a quotation from St. Augustine, and so on), a few samples of John Shade’s conversation which I had collected in order to refer to them in the presence of people whom my friendship with the poet might interest or annoy. His and my reader will, I trust, excuse me for breaking the orderly course of these comments and letting my illustrious friend speak for himself.
