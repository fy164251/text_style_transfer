hat,
I cannot name. 'Tis nameless woe, I wot.

God save your Majesty!--And well met, gentlemen.
I hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland.

QUEEN
Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is,
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipped?

GREEN
That he, our hope, might have retired his power
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
Who strongly hath set footing in this land.
