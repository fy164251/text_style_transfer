, in that
I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
To have you therein my companion.

WOLSEY  Sir,
For holy offices I have a time; a time
To think upon the part of business which
I bear i' th' state; and Nature does require
Her times of preservation, which perforce
I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
Must give my tendance to.

KING  You have said well.

WOLSEY
And ever may your Highness yoke together,
As I will lend you cause, my doing well
With my well saying.

KING
