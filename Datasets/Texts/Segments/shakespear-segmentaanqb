Theseus, Hippolyta,
Emilia, Pirithous, and some Attendants.]


EMILIA
I'll no step further.

PIRITHOUS  Will you lose this sight?

EMILIA
I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly
Than this decision; ev'ry blow that falls
Threats a brave life; each stroke laments
The place whereon it falls, and sounds more like
A bell than blade. I will stay here.
It is enough my hearing shall be punished
With what shall happen, 'gainst the which there is
No deafing but to hear; not taint mine eye
