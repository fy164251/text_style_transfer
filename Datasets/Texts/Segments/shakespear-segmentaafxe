yet to wear. I shall, assuredly.

GRIFFITH
I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
Possess your fancy.

KATHERINE  Bid the music leave.
They are harsh and heavy to me.	[Music ceases.]

PATIENCE, [aside to Griffith]  Do you note
How much her Grace is altered on the sudden?
How long her face is drawn? How pale she looks,
And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes.

GRIFFITH, [aside to Patience]
She is going, wench. Pray, pray.

PATIENCE  Heaven comfort her!

[Enter a Messenger.]
