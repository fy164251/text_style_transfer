ay lay my head in thy
lap.

LADY PERCY  Go, you giddy goose.
[The music plays.]

HOTSPUR
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,
And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
By 'r Lady, he is a good musician.

LADY PERCY  Then should you be nothing but musical,
for you are altogether governed by humors. Lie
still, you thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh.

HOTSPUR  I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in
Irish.

LADY PERCY  Wouldst thou have thy head broken?

HOTSPUR  No.
