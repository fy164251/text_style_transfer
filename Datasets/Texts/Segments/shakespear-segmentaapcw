ANDRA  O farewell, dear Hector.
Look how thou diest! Look how thy eye turns pale!
Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
Hark, how Troy roars, how Hecuba cries out,
How poor Andromache shrills her dolor forth!
Behold, distraction, frenzy, and amazement,
Like witless antics, one another meet,
And all cry "Hector! Hector's dead! O, Hector!"

TROILUS  Away, away!

CASSANDRA
Farewell.--Yet soft! Hector, I take my leave.
Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.	[She exits.]
