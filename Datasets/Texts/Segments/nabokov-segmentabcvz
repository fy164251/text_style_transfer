onths of sickness, I spent a pleasant Christmas reading your book on Gogol.1 I think you over-symbolize the sexual meaning of certain marginal objects, and I am sure you overpraise certain writers: how can one rank the great Griboedov with such a mediocrity as Hmelnitsky? Otherwise your book is a first-rate achievement.

I limit myself to these few lines as I am still groggy after my illness. Wishing you a joyful new year, I remain

yours cordially,

Vladimir Nabokov
