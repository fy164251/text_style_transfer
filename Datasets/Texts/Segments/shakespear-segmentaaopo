gust weary,
Come hither from the furrow and be merry.
Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
In country footing.

[Enter certain Reapers, properly habited. They join with
the Nymphs in a graceful dance, towards the end
whereof Prospero starts suddenly and speaks.]


PROSPERO
I had forgot that foul conspiracy
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Against my life. The minute of their plot
Is almost come.--Well done. Avoid. No more.
