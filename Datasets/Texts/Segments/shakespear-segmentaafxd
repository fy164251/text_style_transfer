KATHERINE, [waking]
Spirits of peace, where are you? Are you all gone,
And leave me here in wretchedness behind you?

GRIFFITH
Madam, we are here.

KATHERINE  It is not you I call for.
Saw you none enter since I slept?

GRIFFITH  None, madam.

KATHERINE
No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
Invite me to a banquet, whose bright faces
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?
They promised me eternal happiness
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
I am not worthy
