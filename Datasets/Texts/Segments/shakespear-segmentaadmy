, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS  Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about.
You'll win two days upon me.

BOTH  Sir, good success.

LEPIDUS  Farewell.

Scene 5
=======
[Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.]


CLEOPATRA
Give me some music--music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.

ALL  The music, ho!

[Enter Mardian the eunuch.]


CLEOPATRA
Let it alone. Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.

CHARMIAN
My arm is sore. Best play with Mardian.
