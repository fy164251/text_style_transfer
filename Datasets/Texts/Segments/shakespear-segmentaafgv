FLUELLEN  Godden to your Worship, good Captain
James.

GOWER  How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit
the mines? Have the pioners given o'er?

MACMORRIS  By Chrish, la, 'tish ill done. The work ish
give over. The trompet sound the retreat. By my
hand I swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill
done. It ish give over. I would have blowed up the
town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, 'tish ill
done, 'tish ill done, by my hand, 'tish ill done.

FLUELLEN  Captain Macmorris,
