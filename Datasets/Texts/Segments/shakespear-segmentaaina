te "good angel" on the devil's horn.
'Tis not the devil's crest. [Knock within.] How now,
who's there?

[Enter Servant.]


SERVANT
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO
Teach her the way. [Servant exits.] O heavens,
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons,
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should reviv
