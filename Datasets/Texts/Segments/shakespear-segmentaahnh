LINE
Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
My red dominical, my golden letter.

PRINCESS
A pox of that jest! And I beshrew all shrows.
But, Katherine, what was sent to you

PRINCESS  Did he not send you twain?

KATHERINE  Yes, madam, and moreover,
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity
