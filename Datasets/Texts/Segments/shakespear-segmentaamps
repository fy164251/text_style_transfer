taking the paper]
Let's see your song. How now, minion!

LUCETTA
Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.

JULIA  You do not?

LUCETTA  No, madam, 'tis too sharp.

JULIA  You, minion, are too saucy.

LUCETTA  Nay, now you are too flat
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant.
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.

JULIA
The mean is drowned with your unruly bass.

LUCETTA
Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.

JULIA
