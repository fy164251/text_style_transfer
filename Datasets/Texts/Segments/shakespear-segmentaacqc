me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow
me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
give me the poor allottery my father left me by

OLIVER  And what wilt thou do--beg when that is

troubled with you. You shall have some part of your
will. I pray you leave me.

ORLANDO  I will no further offend you than becomes
me for my good.
