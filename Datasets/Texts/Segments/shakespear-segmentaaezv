ours come back. That did I never hear.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, he turns back
for very fear.

ADRIANA
As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou
reason!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he's
worth to season.
Nay, he's a thief too. Have you not heard men say
That time comes stealing on by night and day?
If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the
way,
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
