into bench-holes. I have yet
Room for six scotches more.

[Enter Eros.]


EROS
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.

SCARUS  Let us score their backs
And snatch 'em up as we take hares, behind.
'Tis sport to maul a runner.

ANTONY  I will reward thee
Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold
For thy good valor. Come thee on.

SCARUS  I'll halt after.
[They exit.]

[Alarum. Enter Antony again in a march;
Scarus, with others.]
