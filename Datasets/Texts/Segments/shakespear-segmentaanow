THESEUS
You valiant and strong-hearted enemies,
You royal german foes, that this day come
To blow that nearness out that flames between you,
Lay by your anger for an hour and, dove-like,
Before the holy altars of your helpers,
The all-feared gods, bow down your stubborn
bodies.
Your ire is more than mortal; so your help be.
And as the gods regard you, fight with justice.
I'll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt you
I part my wishes.
