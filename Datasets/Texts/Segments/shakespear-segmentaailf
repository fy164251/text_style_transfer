and Pompey.]


ELBOW, [to Officers]  Come, bring them away. If these
be good people in a commonweal that do nothing
but use their abuses in common houses, I know no
law. Bring them away.

ANGELO  How now, sir, what's your name? And what's
the matter?

ELBOW  If it please your Honor, I am the poor duke's
constable, and my name is Elbow. I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
Honor two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO  Bene
