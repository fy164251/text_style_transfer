have read Edmund White's marvelous first novel FORGETTING ELENA.2 He has now written another one, A WOMAN. I have not yet seen it but Karlinsky of Berkeley, a fine judge of literature, has a very high opinion of it. White has some difficulty finding a publisher because the book is too good. Would you agree to consider it for McG-H if he sends you a typescript? Would you read it personally?

Yes, I shall be at Montreux throughout April.





Cordially yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
