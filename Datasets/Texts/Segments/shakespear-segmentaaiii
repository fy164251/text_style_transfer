sees a wretched image bound,
That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent.
His face, though full of cares, yet showed content;
  Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,
  So mild that patience seemed to scorn his woes.

In him the painter labored with his skill
To hide deceit and give the harmless show
An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,
A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe,
Cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
  That blushing red no guilty instance gave,
