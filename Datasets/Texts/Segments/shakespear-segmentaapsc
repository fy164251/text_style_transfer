ZELL  Good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES  Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honored lord, is feared and loved?

FLORIZELL
Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose
daughter
His tears proclaimed his, parting with her. Thence,
A prosperous south wind friendly, we have crossed
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your Highness. My best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed,
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
