he grass,

And how delightful when a fall of snow

10 Covered my glimpse of lawn and reached up so

As to make chair and bed exactly stand

Upon that snow, out in that crystal land!



Retake the falling snow: each drifting flake

Shapeless and slow, unsteady and opaque,

A dull dark white against the dayâ€™s pale white

And abstract larches in the neutral light.

And then the gradual and dual blue

As night unites the viewer and the view,

And in the morning, diamonds of frost

20 Express amaze
