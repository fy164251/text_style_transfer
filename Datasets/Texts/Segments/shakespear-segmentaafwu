me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,
That the great child of honor, Cardinal Wolsey,
Was dead?

GRIFFITH  Yes, madam, but I think your Grace,
Out of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to 't.

KATHERINE
Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.
If well, he stepped before me happily
For my example.

GRIFFITH  Well, the voice goes, madam;
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York and brought him forward,
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
He fell sick suddenly
