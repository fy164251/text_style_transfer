CLIFFORD
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!

WESTMORLAND
I cannot stay to hear these articles.

NORTHUMBERLAND  Nor I.

CLIFFORD
Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.

WESTMORLAND
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no spark of honor bides.

NORTHUMBERLAND
Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
And die in bands for this unmanly deed.

CLIFFORD
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
Or live in peace abandoned and despised!
