ive reply to my appeal. I am not sure I can afford to consult a lawyer (I am absolutely pennyless at this moment and owe my bank 800 dollars), but I am writing my Paris agent asking her to act along the lines you suggest.

By the way, she is offering me a contract with Mondadori4 for LOLITA—150.000 Fr. frs. advance, 8% up to 3000 copies, 10% to 5000, 12% after 5000—and with Rowohlt for the German rights—150.000 Fr. frs. advance, 8% up to 5.000 copies, 10% up to 10.000, 12% over 10.000. Doe
