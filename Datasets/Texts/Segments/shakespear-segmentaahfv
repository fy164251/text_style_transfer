ESSENGER
Where is my prince, the Dauphin?

DAUPHIN  Here. What news?

MESSENGER
The Count Melun is slain. The English lords,
By his persuasion, are again fall'n off,
And your supply, which you have wished so long,
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.

DAUPHIN
Ah, foul, shrewd news. Beshrew thy very heart!
I did not think to be so sad tonight
As this hath made me. Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
