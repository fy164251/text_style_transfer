be of clouts were he.
I am not mad. Too well, too well I feel
The different plague of each calamity.

KING PHILIP
Bind up those tresses.--O, what love I note
In the fair multitude of those her hairs;
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fall'n,
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
Sticking together in calamity.

CONSTANCE
To England, if you will.

KING PHILIP  Bind up your hairs.

CONSTANCE
