damned.
Swear thou art honest.

DESDEMONA  Heaven doth truly know it.

OTHELLO
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

DESDEMONA, [standing]
To whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?

OTHELLO
Ah, Desdemon, away, away, away!

DESDEMONA
Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,
I have lost him too.

OTHELLO
