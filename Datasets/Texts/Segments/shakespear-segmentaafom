His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.

LORDS  Amen.

KING HENRY
Now welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.

God, the best maker of all marriages,
Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one.
As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
That never may ill office or fell jealousy,
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,
