But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child forgiveness!

PROSPERO  There, sir, stop.
Let us not burden our remembrances with
A heaviness that's gone.

Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you
gods,
And on this couple drop a blessed crown,
For it is you that have chalked forth the way
Which brought us hither.

ALONSO  I say "Amen," Gonzalo.
