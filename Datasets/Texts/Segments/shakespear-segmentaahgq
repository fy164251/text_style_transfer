And one day in a week to touch no food,
And but one meal on every day besides,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
When I was wont to think no harm all night,
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.
