curer of souls, and you a curer of bodies. If you

fighter, though now a man of peace.

SHALLOW  Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old
and of the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger
itches to make one. Though we are justices and
doctors and churchmen, Master Page, we have
some salt of our youth in us.
