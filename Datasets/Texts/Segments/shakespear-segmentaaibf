REGAN
Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

EDMUND
'Tis to be doubted, madam.

REGAN  Now, sweet lord,
You know the goodness I intend upon you;
Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth,
Do you not love my sister?

EDMUND  In honored love.

REGAN
But have you never found my brother's way
To the forfended place?

EDMUND  That thought abuses you.

REGAN
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
And bosomed with her as far as we call hers.
