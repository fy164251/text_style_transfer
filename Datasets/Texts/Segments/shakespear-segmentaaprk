AUTOLYCUS  O, that's the case of the shepherd's son!
Hang him, he'll be made an example.

SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Shepherd]  Comfort, good comfort.
We must to the King, and show our strange
sights. He must know 'tis none of your daughter nor
my sister. We are gone else.--Sir, I will give you as
much as this old man does when the business is
performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it
be brought you.

AUTOLYCUS  I will trust you. Walk before toward the
seaside.
