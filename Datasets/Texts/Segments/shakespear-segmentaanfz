wind and the rain,
	By swaggering could I never thrive,
	   For the rain it raineth every day.

	But when I came unto my beds,
	   With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
	With tosspots still had drunken heads,
	   For the rain it raineth every day.

	A great while ago the world begun,
	   With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
	But that's all one, our play is done,
	   And we'll strive to please you every day.
