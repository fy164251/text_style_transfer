ELL  Do, and be witness to 't.

POLIXENES
And this my neighbor too?

FLORIZELL  And he, and more
Than he, and men--the Earth, the heavens, and
all--
That were I crowned the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
Without her love; for her employ them all,
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.

POLIXENES  Fairly offered.
