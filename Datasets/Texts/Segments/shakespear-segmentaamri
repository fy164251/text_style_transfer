ntonio, your countryman?

VALENTINE
Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
To be of worth and worthy estimation,
And not without desert so well reputed.

DUKE  Hath he not a son?

VALENTINE
Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves
The honor and regard of such a father.

DUKE  You know him well?

VALENTINE

We have conversed and spent our hours together,
And though myself have been an idle truant,
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
