eper matter.

EMILIA  Pray stand up.
Your grief is written in your cheek.

THIRD QUEEN  O, woe!
You cannot read it there.	[She rises.]
There through my tears,
Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,
You may behold 'em. Lady, lady, alack!
He that will all the treasure know o' th' Earth
Must know the center too; he that will fish
For my least minnow, let him lead his line
To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me!
Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,
Makes me a fool.

EMILIA  Pray
