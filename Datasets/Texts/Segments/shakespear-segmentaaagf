hat no persuasion can do good upon.
[The Lady speaks in Welsh.]

MORTIMER
I understand thy looks. That pretty Welsh
Which thou pourest down from these swelling
heavens
I am too perfect in, and but for shame
In such a parley should I answer thee.
[The Lady speaks again in Welsh. They kiss.]
I understand thy kisses, and thou mine,
And that's a feeling disputation;
But I will never be a truant, love,
Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties high
