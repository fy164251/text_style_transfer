[Enter a Servant.]


SERVANT
One that gives out himself Prince Florizell,
Son of Polixenes, with his princess--she
The fairest I have yet beheld--desires access
To your high presence.

LEONTES  What with him? He comes not
Like to his father's greatness. His approach,
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
By need and accident. What train?

SERVANT  But few,
And those but mean.

LEONTES  His princess, say you, with him?
