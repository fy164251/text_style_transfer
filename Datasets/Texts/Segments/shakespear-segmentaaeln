CLOTEN  Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no
derogation in 't?

SECOND LORD  You cannot derogate, my lord.

CLOTEN  Not easily, I think.

SECOND LORD, [aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore
your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.

CLOTEN  Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost
today at bowls I'll win tonight of him.
