 OUTLAW  Whence came you?

VALENTINE  From Milan.

THIRD OUTLAW  Have you long sojourned there?

VALENTINE
Some sixteen months, and longer might have stayed
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.

FIRST OUTLAW  What, were you banished thence?

VALENTINE  I was.

SECOND OUTLAW  For what offense?

VALENTINE
For that which now torments me to rehearse;
I killed a man, whose death I much repent,
But yet I slew him manfully in fight
Without false vantage or base treachery.
