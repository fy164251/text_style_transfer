practices;
Or if he were not privy to those faults,
Yet, by reputing of his high descent--
As next the King he was successive heir,
And such high vaunts of his nobility--
Did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess
By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
And in his simple show he harbors treason.
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
