Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,
Hath here distrained the Tower to his use.

WINCHESTER
Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,
One that still motions war and never peace,
O'ercharging your free purses with large fines;
That seeks to overthrow religion
Because he is Protector of the realm,
And would have armor here out of the Tower
To crown himself king and suppress the Prince.

GLOUCESTER
I will not answer thee with words, but blows.
[Here they skirmish again.]
