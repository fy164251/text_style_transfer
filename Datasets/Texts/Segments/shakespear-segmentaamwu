 applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
And think thee worthy of an empress' love.
Know, then, I here forget all former griefs,
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
Plead a new state in thy unrivaled merit,
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
Thou art a gentleman, and well derived;
Take thou thy Sylvia, for thou hast deserved her.

VALENTINE
I thank your Grace, the gift hath made me happy.
I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.
