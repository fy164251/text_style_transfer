er's led,
And we are women's men.

SOLDIER  You keep by land
The legions and the horse whole, do you not?

CANIDIUS
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
Publicola, and Caelius are for sea,
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
Carries beyond belief.

SOLDIER  While he was yet in Rome,
His power went out in such distractions as
Beguiled all spies.

CANIDIUS  Who's his lieutenant, hear you?

SOLDIER
They say one Taurus.

CANIDIUS  Well I know the man.
