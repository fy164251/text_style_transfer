MARINA  Sir, I will use
My utmost skill in his recovery, provided
That none but I and my companion maid
Be suffered to come near him.

LYSIMACHUS  Come, let us
Leave her, and the gods make her prosperous.
[Lysimachus, Helicanus and others move aside.]

LYSIMACHUS, [coming forward]
Marked he your music?

MARINA  No, nor looked on us.

LYSIMACHUS, [moving aside]
See, she will speak to him.
