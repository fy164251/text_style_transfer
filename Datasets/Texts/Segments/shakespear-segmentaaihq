t' afford,
If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see,
Some present speed to come and visit me.
  So I commend me from our house in grief.
  My woes are tedious, though my words are brief."

Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,
Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.
By this short schedule Collatine may know
Her grief, but not her grief's true quality.
She dares not thereof make discovery
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
  Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse.
