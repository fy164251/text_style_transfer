 repulse, forgo the purpose
That you resolved t' effect.

SEBASTIAN, [aside to Antonio]  The next advantage
Will we take throughly.

ANTONIO, [aside to Sebastian]  Let it be tonight;
For now they are oppressed with travel, they
Will not nor cannot use such vigilance
As when they are fresh.

SEBASTIAN, [aside to Antonio]  I say tonight. No more.

[Solemn and strange music, and enter Prospero on the
top invisible.]

What harmony is this? My good friends, hark.
