er, interest me to know how independent I should be in my selections and decisions. If possible, I would like to know who is going to be Head of the Department and what would be the exact separating line between his authority and mine.

As to the salary, I am afraid that $7,500 would be the minimum I could accept. Since I sent in my application there has been a very large increase in prices. I have also found out that moving to New York must cost much more than I had thought.

Sincerely yours,
