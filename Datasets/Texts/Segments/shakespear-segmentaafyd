ake my boldness manners.--Now, good angels
Fly o'er thy royal head and shade thy person
Under their blessed wings!

KING  Now by thy looks
I guess thy message. Is the Queen delivered?
Say "Ay, and of a boy."

OLD LADY  Ay, ay, my liege,
And of a lovely boy. The God of heaven
Both now and ever bless her! 'Tis a girl
Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
Desires your visitation, and to be
Acquainted with this stranger. 'Tis as like you
As cherry is to cherry.

KING  Lovell.
