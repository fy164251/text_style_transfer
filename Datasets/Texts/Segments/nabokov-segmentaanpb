s parties games were rough, no doubt,

And one shy little guest might be left out;

But let’s be fair: while children of her age

310 Were cast as elves and fairies on the stage

That she’d helped paint for the school pantomime,

My gentle girl appeared as Mother Time,

A bent charwoman with slop pail and broom,

And like a fool I sobbed in the men’s room.



Another winter was scrape-scooped away.

The Toothwort White haunted our woods in May.

Summer was power-mowed, and autumn, burned.
