 his argument. I abhor
such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
point-devise companions, such rackers of orthography,
as to speak "dout," fine, when he should
say "doubt"; "det" when he should pronounce
"debt"--d, e, b, t, not d, e, t. He clepeth a calf
"cauf," half "hauf," neighbor vocatur "nebor";
neigh abbreviated ne. This is abhominable--which
he would call "abominable." It insinuateth me of
insanie. Ne intelligis, domine? To make frantic,
lunatic.
