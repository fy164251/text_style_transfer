the hill.

One climbed up a sparkle-splashed platform.â€¦ (Water carried up in buckets to pour on the slide had splashed over the wooden steps so that they were coated with sparkling ice, but the well-meaning alliteration had not been able to get all this in.)

One climbed a sparkle-splashed platform,

One dashingly fell belly first

On the sled, and it rattled

Down the blueness; and then

When the scene underwent a grim change,

And there somberly burned in the nursery

Scarlet fever on Christ
