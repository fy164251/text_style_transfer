om Phaedra the Russian version of LOLITA? We don't know if Phaedra would agree to sell the rights but we could ask in case you were interested. (LOLITA, of course, is printed in accordance with the new orthographic rules). But LOLITA was set in Russian and the costs of production were high.

With best wishes from VN and me.





Sincerely
