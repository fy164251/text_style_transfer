a great pity Panther does not wish to use the 1967 cover-design, but if so, let us have some purely ornamental pattern without eyes, noses, or hands.

Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov

I am returning the jacket design.

To My Sister Elena,





We are distinguished by wings of black hue,

wine-iridescence, and granules of blue

following yellowish, crenulate borders.

Copses of birch are our favorite quarters.
