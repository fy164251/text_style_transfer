Dear Andrew,

I have finished reading the typescript of your "Nabokov".1 At present my cards with corrections are in the process of being typed; there are 250 of them, which is more than I had expected. It was a great mistake on your part not to have shown me the chapters one by one.

I shall be able to mail you the result within a fortnight. Tell me, please, where to send it.
