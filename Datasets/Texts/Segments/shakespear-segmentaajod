ies
Are with a most indissoluble tie
Forever knit.

MACBETH  Ride you this afternoon?

BANQUO  Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH
We should have else desired your good advice
(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)
In this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.
Is 't far you ride?

BANQUO
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain.

MACBETH  Fail not our feast.
