r of Feb. 20th arrived today. I therefore think it safer to send my answer to your new address, it would hardly reach Columbus before March 1.

Here is a suggestion for a title from VN: "A Nabokov Congeries" or "Nabokov's Congeries." He would like to have your and Viking's reaction to this "perhaps fanciful suggestion."

We hope you will be very happy in your new job and surroundings. I have seen a nice review of your bookâ€”by Granville Hicks, I believe.

With cordial greetings, from VN and fro
