

MARGARET  Troth, I think your other rebato were
better.

HERO  No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.

MARGARET  By my troth, 's not so good, and I warrant
your cousin will say so.

HERO  My cousin's a fool, and thou art another. I'll
wear none but this.

MARGARET  I like the new tire within excellently, if the
hair were a thought browner; and your gown's a
most rare fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of
Milan's gown that they praise so.

HERO  O, that exceeds, they say.
