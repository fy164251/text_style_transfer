	   Adieu, adieu, adieu.	[Thisbe falls.]

THESEUS  Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the
dead.

DEMETRIUS  Ay, and Wall too.
[Bottom and Flute arise.]

BOTTOM  No, I assure you, the wall is down that
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between
two of our company?

no excuse. Never excuse. For when the players are
all dead, there need none to be blamed. Ma
