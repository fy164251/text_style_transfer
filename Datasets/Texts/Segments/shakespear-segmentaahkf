les. For thyself?
Me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy
foot, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every
part.
	Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
Don Adriano de Armado.
	Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
	   'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
	Submissive fall his princely feet before,
	   And he from forage will incline to play.
	But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
	Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
