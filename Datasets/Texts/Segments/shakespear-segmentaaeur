u are upon a rock, and now
Throw me again.	[She embraces him.]

POSTHUMUS  Hang there like fruit, my soul,

IMOGEN, [kneeling]  Your blessing, sir.

BELARIUS, [as Morgan, aside to Guiderius and Arviragus]
Though you did love this youth, I blame you not.

CYMBELINE, [to Imogen]  My tears that fall
Prove holy water
