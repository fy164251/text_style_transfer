FIRST FAIRY
	You spotted snakes with double tongue,
	   Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen.
	Newts and blindworms, do no wrong,
	   Come not near our Fairy Queen.

CHORUS
	   Philomel, with melody
	   Sing in our sweet lullaby.
	Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.
	   Never harm
	   Nor spell nor charm
	Come our lovely lady nigh.
	So good night, with lullaby.

FIRST FAIRY
	Weaving spiders, come not here.
	   Hence, you long-legged spinners, hence.
	Beetles
