Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.

HECTOR, [to Aeneas]
The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
But for Achilles, my own searching eyes
Shall find him by his large and portly size.

AGAMEMNON
Worthy all arms! As welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy--
But that's no welcome. Understand more clear:
What's past and what's to come is strewed with husks
And formless ruin
