TIMON  Painting is welcome.
The painting is almost the natural man,
For, since dishonor traffics with man's nature,
He is but outside; these penciled figures are
Even such as they give out. I like your work,
And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance
Till you hear further from me.

PAINTER  The gods preserve you.

TIMON
Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand.
We must needs dine together.--Sir, your jewel
Hath suffered under praise.

JEWELER  What, my lord?
