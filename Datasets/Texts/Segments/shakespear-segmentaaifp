ve battered down her consecrated wall
And, by their mortal fault, brought in subjection
Her immortality, and made her thrall
To living death and pain perpetual,
  Which in her prescience she controlled still,
  But her foresight could not forestall their will.

E'en in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,
A captive victor that hath lost in gain,
Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,
The scar that will, despite of cure, remain,
Leaving his spoil perplexed in greater
