
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

YORK
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

RICHARD  How?

YORK  Little.

PRINCE
My lord of York will still be cross in talk.
Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.

YORK
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.--
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.
Because that I am little, like an ape,
He thinks that you should bear me on your
shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM, [aside]
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
