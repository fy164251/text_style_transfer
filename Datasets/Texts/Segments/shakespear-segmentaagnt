HORATIO
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on

But let this same be presently performed
Even while men's minds are wild, lest more

On plots and errors happen.

FORTINBRAS  Let four captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royal; and for his passage,
The soldier's music and the rite of war
Speak loudly for him.
