ovel, two short stories, translations for my lectures, some Russian stuff and a huge scientific paper about certain butterflies I have discovered. I think I told you that the Atlantic has finally acquired "Mile O".2 I have also sold two poems to the New Yorker.

There are rumors that you are going to get married. If so I congratulate you most cordiallyâ€”it is a very pleasant state as far as my own experience goes.

When shall I see you?
