BAPTISTA  You are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO  And yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA  And yet you halt not.

TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Not so well appareled as I wish

But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown.
And wherefore gaze this goodly company
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA
