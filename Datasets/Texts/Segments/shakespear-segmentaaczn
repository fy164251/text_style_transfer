 ne'er wed woman, if you be not
she.

HYMEN
	Peace, ho! I bar confusion.
	'Tis I must make conclusion
	   Of these most strange events.
	Here's eight that must take hands
	To join in Hymen's bands,
	   If truth holds true contents.
[To Rosalind and Orlando.]
	You and you no cross shall part.
[To Celia and Oliver.]
	You and you are heart in heart.
[To Phoebe.]
	You to his love must accord
	Or have a woman to your lord.
[To Audrey and Touchstone.]
	You and you are sure together
