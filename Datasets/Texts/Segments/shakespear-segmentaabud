 hast lost it all.

KING HENRY
The Lord Protector lost it and not I.
When I was crowned, I was but nine months old.

RICHARD
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you
lose.--
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.

EDWARD
Sweet father, do so. Set it on your head.

MONTAGUE, [to York]
Good brother, as thou lov'st and honorest arms,
Let's fight it out and not stand caviling thus.

RICHARD
Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.

YORK  Sons, peace!
