 then, and leave thine insolence.
Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack,
The Dauphin hath prevailed beyond the seas,
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.

CARDINAL, [to Gloucester]
The Commons hast thou racked; the clergy's bags
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.

SOMERSET, [to Gloucester]
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
Have cost a mass of public treasury.
