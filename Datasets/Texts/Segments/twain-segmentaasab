into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around
till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,

coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever
catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.
