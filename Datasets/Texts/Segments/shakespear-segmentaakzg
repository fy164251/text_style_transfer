etter for the King of heaven that hath him.

ANNE
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

RICHARD
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither,
For he was fitter for that place than Earth.

ANNE
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

RICHARD
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

ANNE  Some dungeon.

RICHARD  Your bedchamber.

ANNE
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

RICHARD
So will it, madam, till I lie with you.

ANNE
I hope so.
