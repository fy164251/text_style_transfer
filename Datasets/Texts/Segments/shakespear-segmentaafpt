kes bold
mouths.
Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
Allegiance in them. Their curses now
Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass
This tractable obedience is a slave
To each incensed will. I would your Highness
Would give it quick consideration, for
There is no primer baseness.

KING  By my life,
This is against our pleasure.

WOLSEY  And for me,
I have no further gone in this than by
A single voice, and that not passed me but
By learned approbation
