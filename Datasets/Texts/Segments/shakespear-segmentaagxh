. [To Robert
Faulconbridge] Sirrah, speak.
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?

PHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE
Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
With half that face would he have all my land--
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!

ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
Your brother did employ my father much--

PHILIP FAULCONBRIDGE
Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land.
Your tale must be how he employed my mother.
