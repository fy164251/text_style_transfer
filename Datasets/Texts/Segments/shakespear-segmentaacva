'll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good
Signior Love.

ORLANDO  I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good
Monsieur Melancholy.	[Jaques exits.]

ROSALIND, [aside to Celia]  I will speak to him like a
saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave
with him. [As Ganymede.] Do you hear, forester?

ORLANDO  Very well. What would you?

ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I pray you, what is 't
o'clock?

ORLANDO  You should ask me what time o' day. There's
no clock in the forest.
