 heavens, through you,
Increase our wonder, and sets up your fame
Forever.

CERIMON  She is alive. Behold her eyelids--
Cases to those heavenly jewels which Pericles hath
lost--
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold.

Appear to make the world twice rich.--Live,
And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
Rare as you seem to be.
[She moves.]

THAISA  O dear Diana,
Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?
