come unto this place,
He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,
Depart untouched.

SERVANT  I'll fetch him presently.
[Servant exits.]

BRUTUS
I know that we shall have him well to friend.

CASSIUS
I wish we may; but yet have I a mind
That fears him much, and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.

[Enter Antony.]


BRUTUS
But here comes Antony.--Welcome, Mark Antony!

ANTONY
O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils
