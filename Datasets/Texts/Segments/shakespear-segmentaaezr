 is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
Ill-faced, worse-bodied, shapeless everywhere,
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

LUCIANA
Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone.

ADRIANA
Ah, but I think him better than I say,
   And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away.
   My heart prays for him, though my tongue do
   curse.
