Dear Mr. Minton,

Thanks for your letters and the check.

Yes, I quite see your point and agree with you that the inclusion of the article might add an extraneous element to the book. I would be delighted to have it re-published in the form you suggest,â€”with Doubleday's consent.

I am sending you herewith a copy of LOLITA which we have checked for misprints and errors. I would not like to change the paragraphic division, and would like to be consulted on any questions
