 upon thyself! The
common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance,
be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from
a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy
blood be thy direction till thy death; then if she
that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be
sworn and sworn upon 't she never shrouded any
but lazars. Amen.

prayer?

THERSITES  Ay. The heavens hear me!
