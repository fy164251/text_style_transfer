kewise will visit thee with mine.

PROTEUS
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.

VALENTINE
As much to you at home. And so farewell.	[He exits.]

PROTEUS
He after honor hunts, I after love.
He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;
I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
