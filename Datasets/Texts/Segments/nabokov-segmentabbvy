Dear Mr. Harris,

I am informed that a French motion picture company is about to make a picture entitled "The Nymphets" ("Les Nymphettes"). The use of this title is an infringement of my rights since this term was invented by me for the main character in my novel Lolita and has now become completely synonymous with Lolita in the minds of readers throughout the world.

In other words, any title with the term "nymphet" in it would naturally and inevitably sugge
