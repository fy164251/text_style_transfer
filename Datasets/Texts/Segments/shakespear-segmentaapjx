e of us in distemper, but
I cannot name the disease, and it is caught
Of you that yet are well.

POLIXENES  How caught of me?
Make me not sighted like the basilisk.
I have looked on thousands who have sped the
better
By my regard, but killed none so. Camillo,
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerklike experienced, which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behoove my
knowledge
