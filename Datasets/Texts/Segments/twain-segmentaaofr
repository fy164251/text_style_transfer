 a capacious container, but he
did not hold enough for that.  He took a level tumblerful of whisky every
morning before he put his clothes on--“to sweeten his bilgewater,” he
said.--He took another after he got the most of his clothes on, “to
settle his mind and give him his bearings.”  He then shaved, and put on a
clean shirt; after which he recited the Lord's Prayer in a fervent,
thundering bass that shook the ship to her kelson and suspended all
conversation in the main cabin.
