IACHIMO  First, her bedchamber--
Where I confess I slept not, but profess
Had that was well worth watching--it was hanged
With tapestry of silk and silver, the story
Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
And Cydnus swelled above the banks, or for
The press of boats or pride. A piece of work
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
In workmanship and value
