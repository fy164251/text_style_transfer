NA
The Count Rossillion. Know you such a one?

HELEN, [as pilgrim]
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him.
His face I know not.

DIANA  Whatsome'er he is,
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
As 'tis reported, for the King had married him
Against his liking. Think you it is so?

HELEN, [as pilgrim]
Ay, surely, mere the truth. I know his lady.

DIANA
There is a gentleman that serves the Count
Reports but coarsely of her.

HELEN, [as pilgrim]  What's his name?
