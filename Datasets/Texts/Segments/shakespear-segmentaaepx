US, [as Morgan]  Hark, boys.
[They talk aside.]

IMOGEN  Great men
That had a court no bigger than this cave,
That did attend themselves and had the virtue
Which their own conscience sealed them, laying by

Could not outpeer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
Since Leonatus false.

BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  It shall be so.
Boys, we'll go dress our hunt.--Fair youth, come in.
Discourse is heavy, fasting.
