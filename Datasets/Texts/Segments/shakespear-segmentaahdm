[To Bastard.] Now, what says the world
To your proceedings? Do not seek to stuff
My head with more ill news, for it is full.

BASTARD
But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
Then let the worst, unheard, fall on your head.

KING JOHN
Bear with me, cousin, for I was amazed
Under the tide, but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood and can give audience
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.

BASTARD
How I have sped among the clergymen
The sums I have collected shall express.
