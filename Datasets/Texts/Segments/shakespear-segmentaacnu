der my poor instructions yet must suffer
Something in my behalf.

DIANA  Let death and honesty
Go with your impositions, I am yours
Upon your will to suffer.

HELEN  Yet, I pray you--
But with the word "The time will bring on summer,"
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away.
Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us.
All's well that ends well. Still the fine's the crown.
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.
