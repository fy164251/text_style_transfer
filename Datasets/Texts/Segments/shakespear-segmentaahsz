an thou showest.
	Speak less than thou knowest,
	Lend less than thou owest,
	Ride more than thou goest,
	Learn more than thou trowest,
	Set less than thou throwest;
	Leave thy drink and thy whore
	And keep in-a-door,
	And thou shalt have more
	Than two tens to a score.

LEAR  Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of
nothing.
