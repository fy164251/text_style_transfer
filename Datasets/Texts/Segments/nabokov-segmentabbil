g, and would like to see you on the 16th (any time is convenient) or on the 17th (evening only). We shall leave early on the 18th. It would be helpful if you could let me know now what is your preference, for I would like to plan the rest of my stay.

Yes, I have met Fred Dupee, though not in the Partisan Review, but years ago on a little peak in Darien.

The signed agreements must have reached you by now.





Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
