madonna. Good my
mouse of virtue, answer me.

OLIVIA  Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide

FOOL  Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?

OLIVIA  Good Fool, for my brother's death.

FOOL  I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

OLIVIA  I know his soul is in heaven, Fool.

FOOL  The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your
brother's soul, being in heaven. Take away the fool,
gentlemen.

OLIVIA  What think you of this Fool, Malvolio? Doth he
not mend?

MALVOLIO
