My father made in compassing the crown.
I Richard's body have interred new
And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
Than from it issued forced drops of blood.
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay
Who twice a day their withered hands hold up
Toward heaven to pardon blood. And I have built
Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests
Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do--
Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
Since that my penitence comes after all,
