S  Stay, I will go with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH
You have no cause.

ARCHBISHOP, [to Queen Elizabeth]  My gracious lady, go,
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto your Grace
The seal I keep; and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours.
Go. I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
