HELEN
Pray, sir, your pardon.

BERTRAM  Well, what would you say?

HELEN
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
Nor dare I say 'tis mine--and yet it is--
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
What law does vouch mine own.

BERTRAM  What would you have?

HELEN
Something, and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.
I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith,
yes:
Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.

BERTRAM
I pray you stay not, but in haste to horse.
