[Enter behind them Prince and Poins disguised.]


FALSTAFF  Peace, good Doll. Do not speak like a death's-head;
do not bid me remember mine end.

DOLL  Sirrah, what humor's the Prince of?

FALSTAFF  A good shallow young fellow, he would have
made a good pantler; he would 'a chipped bread
well.

DOLL  They say Poins has a good wit.

FALSTAFF  He a good wit? Hang him, baboon. His wit's
as thick as Tewkesbury mustard. There's no more
conceit in him than is in a mallet.
