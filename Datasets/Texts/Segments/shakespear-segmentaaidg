rprop her fame.
When Virtue bragged, Beauty would blush for shame;
  When Beauty boasted blushes, in despite
  Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white.

But Beauty, in that white entituled
From Venus' doves, doth challenge that fair field.
Then Virtue claims from Beauty Beauty's red,
Which Virtue gave the golden age to gild
Their silver cheeks, and called it then their shield,
  Teaching them thus to use it in the fight:
  When shame assailed, the red should fence the white.
