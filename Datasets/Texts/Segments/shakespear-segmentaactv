 sans everything.

[Enter Orlando, carrying Adam.]


DUKE SENIOR
Welcome. Set down your venerable burden,
And let him feed.

ORLANDO  I thank you most for him.

ADAM  So had you need.--
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

DUKE SENIOR
Welcome. Fall to. I will not trouble you
As yet to question you about your fortunes.--
Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.

[The Duke and Orlando continue their conversation,
apart.]


Song.


AMIENS [sings]
