The laws ruling the publication and copyrighting of works by American authors may not apply in the case of the books he wrote before coming to the U.S. and being naturalized. The rules are not very clear in the case of such works. The Copyright Office was very lenient and copyrighted for him all his works which were not yet 28 years
