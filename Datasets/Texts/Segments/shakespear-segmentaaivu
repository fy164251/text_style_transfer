 the temple, in the town, the field,
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.
We cannot fight for love as men may do.
We should be wooed and were not made to woo.
[Demetrius exits.]
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
To die upon the hand I love so well.	[Helena exits.]

OBERON
Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.

[Enter Robin.]

Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
