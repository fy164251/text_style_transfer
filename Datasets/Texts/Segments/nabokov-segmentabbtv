of it.

Here is something I would like to ask you: please do not ask Edmund Wilson for any endorsement of this or any other of my books. Personally, I am against all endorsementsâ€”especially the ones that come from old friends. In this case, however, I am prompted to say what I say by my utter disgust with Edmund's symbolico-social criticism and phoney erudition in regard to DOCTOR ZHIVAGO.

There is a funny LOLITA cartoon in the July Playboy.1

Regards.





As ever,

Vladimir Nabokov
