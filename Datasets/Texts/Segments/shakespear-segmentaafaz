ANGELO
Of very reverend reputation, sir,
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
Second to none that lives here in the city.
His word might bear my wealth at any time.

[Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse again,
Antipholus wearing the chain.]

Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
Good sir, draw near to me. I'll speak to him.--
