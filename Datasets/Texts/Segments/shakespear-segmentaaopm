me to you at the farthest
	In the very end of harvest.
	Scarcity and want shall shun you.
	Ceres' blessing so is on you.

FERDINAND
This is a most majestic vision, and
Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold
To think these spirits?

PROSPERO  Spirits, which by mine art
I have from their confines called to enact
My present fancies.

FERDINAND  Let me live here ever.
So rare a wondered father and a wise
Makes this place paradise.
[Juno and Ceres whisper,
and send Iris on employment.
