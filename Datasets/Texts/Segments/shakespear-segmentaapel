k; so shall the day seem night.
Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;
Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight.
  These blue-veined violets whereon we lean
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.

"The tender spring upon thy tempting lip
Shows thee unripe, yet mayst thou well be tasted.
Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
Beauty within itself should not be wasted.
  Fair flowers that are not gathered in their prime
  Rot and consume themselves in little time.
