no's eyes
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,
That die unmarried ere they can behold
Bright Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one--O, these I lack
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er.

FLORIZELL  What, like a corse?

PERDITA
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on,
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms.
