 O, if you love my mother,
Dishonor not her honorable name
To make a bastard and a slave of me!
The world will say "He is not Talbot's blood,
That basely fled when noble Talbot stood."

TALBOT
Fly, to revenge my death if I be slain.

JOHN TALBOT
He that flies so will ne'er return again.

TALBOT
If we both stay, we both are sure to die.

JOHN TALBOT
Then let me stay and, father, do you fly.
Your loss is great; so your regard should be.
My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.
