As far as Belmont.

JESSICA  In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
And ne'er a true one.

LORENZO  In such a night
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

JESSICA

But hark, I hear the footing of a man.

[Enter Stephano, a Messenger.]


LORENZO
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

STEPHANO  A friend.
