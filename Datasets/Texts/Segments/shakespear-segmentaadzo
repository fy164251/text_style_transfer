ing them
In human action and capacity
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in their war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

SICINIUS  This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want
If he be put upon 't, and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze
Shall darken him forever.
