d knows I will not do it, to the death.

CATESBY
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind.

But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
That they which brought me in my master's hate,
I live to look upon their tragedy.

I'll send some packing that yet think not on 't.

CATESBY
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unprepared and look not for it.

HASTINGS
O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
