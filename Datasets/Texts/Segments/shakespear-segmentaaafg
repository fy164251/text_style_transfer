[Enter Bardolph running.]


BARDOLPH  O my lord, my lord, the Sheriff with a most
monstrous watch is at the door.

FALSTAFF  Out, you rogue.--Play out the play. I have
much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

[Enter the Hostess.]


HOSTESS  O Jesu, my lord, my lord--

PRINCE  Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick.
What's the matter?

HOSTESS  The Sheriff and all the watch are at the door.
They are come to search the house. Shall I let them
in?
