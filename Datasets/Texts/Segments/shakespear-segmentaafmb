cked this glove from his helm. If any
man challenge this, he is a friend to Alencon and an
enemy to our person. If thou encounter any such,
apprehend him, an thou dost me love.

FLUELLEN, [putting the glove in his cap]  Your Grace
does me as great honors as can be desired in the
hearts of his subjects. I would fain see the man that
has but two legs that shall find himself aggriefed at
this glove, that is all; but I would fain see it once, an
please God of His grace that I might see.
