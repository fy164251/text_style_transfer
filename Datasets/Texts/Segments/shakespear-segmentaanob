--must be the sacrifice
To my unhappy beauty?

[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous and Attendants.]


THESEUS, [to Attendant]  Bring 'em in
Quickly, by any means; I long to see 'em.
[To Emilia.] Your two contending lovers are
returned,
And with them their fair knights. Now, my fair
sister,
You must love one of them.

EMILIA  I had rather both,
So neither for my sake should fall untimely.

THESEUS
Who saw 'em?

PIRITHOUS  I awhile.

GENTLEMAN  And I.
