JOHN OF LANCASTER
I like this fair proceeding of the King's.
He hath intent his wonted followers
Shall all be very well provided for,
But all are banished till their conversations
Appear more wise and modest to the world.

CHIEF JUSTICE  And so they are.

JOHN OF LANCASTER
The King hath called his parliament, my lord.

CHIEF JUSTICE  He hath.

JOHN OF LANCASTER
I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
We bear our civil swords and native fire
