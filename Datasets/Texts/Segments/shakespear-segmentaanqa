 I will.

DOCTOR
Let's get her in.

WOOER  Come, sweet, we'll go to dinner
And then we'll play at cards.

DAUGHTER  And shall we kiss too?

WOOER
A hundred times.

DAUGHTER  And twenty.

WOOER  Ay, and twenty.

DAUGHTER
And then we'll sleep together.

DOCTOR, [to Wooer]  Take her offer.

WOOER
Yes, marry, will we.

DAUGHTER  But you shall not hurt me.

WOOER
I will not, sweet.

DAUGHTER  If you do, love, I'll cry.
