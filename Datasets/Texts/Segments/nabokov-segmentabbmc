hat Doubleday think of me as of one of "their" authors. They have acquired two more books from me, and will do more than any other publisher to "push" LOLITA, which would be as much to your advantage as to mine (or theirs). For all these reasons I am sorry that you so resolutely rejected their offer.

I was sorry to learn that your lawsuit was postponed. On the other hand, if Gallimard publishes the French translation in the early fall, it may help the outcome. So let us hope for the best.
