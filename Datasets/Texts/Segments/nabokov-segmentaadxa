us American poem



A curious sight — these bashful bears.

These timid warrior whalemen



And now the time of tide has come;

The ship casts off her cables



It is not shown on any map;

True places never are



This lovely light, it lights not me;

All loveliness is anguish —



and, of course, that bit about the delicious death of an Ohio honey hunter (for my humour's sake I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Thula to a lounging circle of my Russian friends).
