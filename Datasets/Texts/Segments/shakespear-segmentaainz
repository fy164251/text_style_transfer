. Dost thou think, Claudio,
If I would yield him my virginity
Thou mightst be freed?

CLAUDIO  O heavens, it cannot be!

ISABELLA
Yes, he would give 't thee; from this rank offense,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest tomorrow.

CLAUDIO  Thou shalt not do 't.

ISABELLA  O, were it but my life,
I'd throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO  Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA
Be ready, Claud
