thus? And besides, you might have to pass through the old part of the
building, and you could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln, as petrified by
a young lady artist for $10,000--and you might take his marble
emancipation proclamation, which he holds out in his hand and
contemplates, for a folded napkin; and you might conceive from his
expression and his attitude, that he is finding fault with the washing.
Which is not the case.
