isualize LOLITA as a little paperback being offered for sale on the newstands?

Let me repeat that I am terribly sorry that this will be a disappointment to you. But I have become convinced that the publication has to be put off at least until I see how the Anchor Review fares, how the Paris litigation is settled, and what decision the Supreme Court takes in some similar cases now before it.





Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
