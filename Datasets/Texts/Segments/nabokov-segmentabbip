ld do without any quotations from Edmund?2 He never wrote anything of value about me except in the case of "Sebastian Knight" his misinterpretation of which he greatly admired. We are very close friends, I admire and respect him greatly, but it is not a friendship based on a similarity of opinions and approaches.

Our best regards to Barbara and you.





Sincerely,
