OPATRA
Be choked with such another emphasis!
Say "the brave Antony."

CHARMIAN  The valiant Caesar!

CLEOPATRA
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men.

CHARMIAN  By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.

CLEOPATRA  My salad days,
When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
To say as I said then. But come, away,
Get me ink and paper.
He shall have every day a several greeting,
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
