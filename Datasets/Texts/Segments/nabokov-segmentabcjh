b. The butterfly part of the cover design is not acceptable. Those two meleagers (?) have nothing to do with the Russian background of the book since they do not occur in the north of Europe; and the female is quite incorrectly colored. Please, no butterflies at all on the cover unless you want to use the white-and-black mnemosyne of the Weidenfeld jacket (also facing their page 19).

NABOKOV'S DOZEN: Blurb: What on earth does "well-varnished truths" mean? Design: This is an impossible monster.
