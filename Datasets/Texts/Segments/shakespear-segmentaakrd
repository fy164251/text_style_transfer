You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts,
And prick my tender patience to those thoughts
Which honor and allegiance cannot think.

What will ensue hereof there's none can tell;
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good.	[He exits.]

KING RICHARD
Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wilts
