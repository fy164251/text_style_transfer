hing saves
The wager you have laid.

IACHIMO  Then if you can
Be pale, I beg but leave to air this jewel. See--
[He shows the bracelet.]
And now 'tis up again. It must be married
To that your diamond. I'll keep them.

POSTHUMUS  Jove!
Once more let me behold it. Is it that
Which I left with her?

IACHIMO  Sir, I thank her, that.
She stripped it from her arm. I see her yet.
Her pretty action did outsell her gift
And yet enriched it too. She gave it me
And said she prized it once.
