ook who comes here. Will you be chid?

JEWELER  We'll bear, with your Lordship.

MERCHANT  He'll spare none.

TIMON
Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus.

APEMANTUS
Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow--
When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.

TIMON
Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know'st
them not.

APEMANTUS  Are they not Athenians?

TIMON  Yes.

APEMANTUS  Then I repent not.

JEWELER  You know me, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS  Thou know'st I do.
