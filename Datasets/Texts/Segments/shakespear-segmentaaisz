[Provost seizes the disguised Duke.]

DUKE, [as Friar]  Stay, sir, stay awhile.

ANGELO  What, resists he?--Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO, [to the disguised Duke]  Come, sir, come, sir,
come, sir. Foh, sir! Why you bald-pated, lying rascal,
you must be hooded, must you? Show your knave's
visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting
face, and be hanged an hour! Will 't not off?
[He pulls off the friar's hood, and reveals the Duke.]
