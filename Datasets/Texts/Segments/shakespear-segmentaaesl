ane is guarded. Nothing routs us but
The villainy of our fears.

GUIDERIUS, as Polydor, and ARVIRAGUS, as Cadwal  Stand, stand, and fight!

[Enter Posthumus, and seconds the Britons. They rescue
Cymbeline and exit. Then enter Lucius, Iachimo, and
Imogen as Fidele.]


LUCIUS, [to Fidele]
Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself,
For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
As war were hoodwinked.

IACHIMO  'Tis their fresh supplies.

LUCIUS
It is a day turned strangely.
