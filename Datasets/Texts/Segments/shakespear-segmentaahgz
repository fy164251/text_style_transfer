,
   For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
   A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
   To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father.
Therefore this article is made in vain,
   Or vainly comes th' admired princess hither.

KING
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.

BEROWNE
So study evermore is overshot.
While it doth study to have what it would,
It doth forget to do the thing it should.
