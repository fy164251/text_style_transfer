may chance cost some of us our lives, for he
will stab.

HOSTESS  Alas the day, take heed of him. He stabbed me
in mine own house, and that most beastly, in good
faith. He cares not what mischief he does. If his
weapon be out, he will foin like any devil. He will
spare neither man, woman, nor child.

FANG  If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.

HOSTESS  No, nor I neither. I'll be at your elbow.

FANG  An I but fist him once, an he come but within my
view--

HOSTESS
