KING HENRY, [handing a jewel to the Ambassador]
In argument and proof of which contract,
Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.--
And so, my Lord Protector, see them guarded
And safely brought to Dover, where, inshipped,
Commit them to the fortune of the sea.
[All except Winchester and Legate exit.]

WINCHESTER
Stay, my Lord Legate; you shall first receive
The sum of money which I promised
Should be delivered to his Holiness
For clothing me in these grave ornaments.
