estion, of doubt.
Be certain, nothing truer, 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.
[Hermia turns him loose.]

HERMIA
O me! [To Helena.] You juggler, you cankerblossom,
You thief of love! What, have you come by night
And stol'n my love's heart from him?

HELENA  Fine, i' faith.
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

HERMIA
"Puppet"? Why so?
