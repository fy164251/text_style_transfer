 me than
fight with mine enemy.

BENEDICK  Is Claudio thine enemy?

BEATRICE  Is he not approved in the height a villain
that hath slandered, scorned, dishonored my kinswoman?
O, that I were a man! What, bear her in
hand until they come to take hands, and then, with
public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated
rancor--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his
heart in the marketplace.

BENEDICK  Hear me, Beatrice--

BEATRICE  Talk with a man out at a window! A proper
saying.
