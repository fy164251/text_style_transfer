
That grudge one thought against your Majesty.

ALL
Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York.

SOMERSET, [aside]

To cross the seas and to be crowned in France.

Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
As it disanimates his enemies.

KING HENRY

For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
