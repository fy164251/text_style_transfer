BISHOP OF ELY
What was th' impediment that broke this off?

BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience. And the hour, I think, is come
To give him hearing. Is it four o'clock?

BISHOP OF ELY  It is.

BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
Then go we in to know his embassy,
Which I could with a ready guess declare
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

BISHOP OF ELY
I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.
