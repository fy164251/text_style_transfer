BUCKINGHAM
Now in good time here comes the Duke of York.

PRINCE
Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?

YORK
Well, my dread lord--so must I call you now.

PRINCE

Too late he died that might have kept that title,
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

RICHARD
How fares our cousin, noble lord of York?
