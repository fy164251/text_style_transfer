r yet one hour in his bed
Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
But with his timorous dreams was still awaked.
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick,
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Poor heart, adieu. I pity thy complaining.

ANNE
No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.

DORSET
Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.

ANNE
Adieu, poor soul that tak'st thy leave of it.

DUCHESS, [to Dorset]
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.
