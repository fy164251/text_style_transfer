 see this hath a little dashed your spirits.

OTHELLO
Not a jot, not a jot.

IAGO  I' faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved.
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.

OTHELLO  I will not.

IAGO  Should you do so, my lord,
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy
friend.
My lord, I see you're moved.

OTH
