It is not lost, but what an if it were?

OTHELLO  How?

DESDEMONA  I say it is not lost.

OTHELLO  Fetch 't. Let me see 't!

DESDEMONA
Why, so I can. But I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit.
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

OTHELLO
Fetch me the handkerchief! [Aside.] My mind
misgives.

DESDEMONA  Come, come.
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

OTHELLO
The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA  I pray, talk me of Cassio.
