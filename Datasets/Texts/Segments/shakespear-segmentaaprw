Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
That e'er the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA  O Hermione,
As every present time doth boast itself
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Give way to what's seen now. [To Servant.] Sir, you
yourself
Have said and writ so--but your writing now
Is colder than that theme--she had not been
Nor was not to be equalled. Thus your verse
Flowed with her beauty once. 'Tis shrewdly ebbed
To say you have seen a better.

SERVANT  Pardon,
