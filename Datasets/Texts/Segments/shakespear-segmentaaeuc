YMBELINE  Ay, with all my heart,
And lend my best attention. What's thy name?

IMOGEN, [as Fidele]
Fidele, sir.

CYMBELINE  Thou 'rt my good youth, my page.
I'll be thy master. Walk with me. Speak freely.
[Cymbeline and Imogen walk aside and talk.]

BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
Is not this boy revived from death?

ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  One sand another
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?

GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  The same dead thing alive.
