	Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
	   Gives her fame which never dies.
	So the life that died with shame
	Lives in death with glorious fame.
[He hangs up the scroll.]
Hang thou there upon the tomb,
Praising her when I am dumb.
Now music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.

	Pardon, goddess of the night,
	Those that slew thy virgin knight,
	For the which with songs of woe,
	Round about her tomb they go.
	   Midnight, assist our moan.
	   Help us to sigh and groan
