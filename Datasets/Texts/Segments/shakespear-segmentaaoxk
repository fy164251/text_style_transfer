give him me. Be true to my lord. If he
flinch, chide me for it.

TROILUS, [to Cressida]  You know now your hostages:
your uncle's word and my firm faith.

PANDARUS  Nay, I'll give my word for her too. Our kindred,
though they be long ere they be wooed, they
are constant being won. They are burrs, I can tell
you; they'll stick where they are thrown.

CRESSIDA
Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart.
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
For many weary months.

TROILU
