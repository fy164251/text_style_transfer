oin in league,
I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor,
The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
[To the Nurse.] But say again, how many saw the

And no one else but the delivered Empress.

AARON
The Empress, the midwife, and yourself.
Two may keep counsel when the third's away.
Go to the Empress; tell her this I said.
[He kills her.]
"Wheak, wheak"! So cries a pig prepared to the spit.
