stress.

CYMBELINE
If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
To death with mortal joy.

PISANIO  How fares my mistress?

IMOGEN  O, get thee from my sight!
Thou gav'st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence.
Breathe not where princes are.

CYMBELINE  The tune of Imogen!

PISANIO
Lady, the gods throw stones of sulfur on me if
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing. I had it from the Queen.

CYMBELINE
New matter still.

IMOGEN  It poisoned me.
