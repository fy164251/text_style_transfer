ouls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws, and on your head
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries,
The dead men's blood, the prived maidens'
groans,
For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers
That shall be swallowed in this controversy.
This is his claim, his threat'ning, and my message--
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
To whom expressly I bring greeting too.

KING OF FRANCE
For us, we will consider of this further.
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
