ar from you anon?

EDMUND  I do serve you in this business.	[Edgar exits.]
A credulous father and a brother noble,
Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easy. I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
[He exits.]

GONERIL  Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding
of his Fool?
