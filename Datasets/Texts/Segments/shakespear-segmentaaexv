our hand to
show;
If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave
were ink,
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I think thou art an ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS  Marry, so it doth appear
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
I should kick being kicked and, being at that pass,
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You're sad, Signior Balthasar. Pray God our cheer
May answer my goodwill and your good welco
