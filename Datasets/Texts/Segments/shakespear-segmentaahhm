KING  It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be
taken with a wench.

COSTARD  I was taken with none, sir. I was taken with a
damsel.

KING  Well, it was proclaimed "damsel."

COSTARD  This was no damsel neither, sir. She was a
virgin.

BEROWNE  It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed
"virgin."

COSTARD  If it were, I deny her virginity. I was taken
with a maid.

KING  This "maid" will not serve your turn, sir.
