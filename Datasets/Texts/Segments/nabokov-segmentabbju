llimard is going to publish the French translation anyway.

I would be very grateful if you gave me your opinion on the various aspects of the affair. I trust your judgment, and do not know anyone else whom I would like as much to consult. I hope this will not be too much trouble.1

Girodias is very happy about Dupee's article and my material. He is going to publish, he says, 2000â€“2500 copies (he mentioned 500 in his previous letter) and sell 1000 numbered copies to defray the costs. Gallimard
