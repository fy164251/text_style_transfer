is time
Had you not fully laid my state before me,
That I might so have rated my expense
As I had leave of means.

FLAVIUS  You would not hear me.
At many leisures I proposed--

TIMON  Go to.
Perchance some single vantages you took
When my indisposition put you back,
And that unaptness made your minister
Thus to excuse yourself.

FLAVIUS  O, my good lord,
At many times I brought in my accounts,
Laid them before you. You would throw them off
And say you found them in mine honesty
