e the revised Ms. ready within a couple of weeks.

I should like to add that some time ago I got acquainted with the average production of Messrs. J. Longâ€”and I feel somehow that "Despair" would be far more in its place if you could publish it under the imprint of Hutchinson instead of John Long. I am afraid that the public for which Messrs. J. Long are working might fail to appreciate "Despair" on account of its rather peculiar character as described in my letter quoted above.

Yours faithful
