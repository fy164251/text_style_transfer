TIMON
A mere satiety of commendations.
If I should pay you for 't as 'tis extolled,
It would unclew me quite.

JEWELER  My lord, 'tis rated
As those which sell would give. But you well know
Things of like value, differing in the owners,
Are prized by their masters. Believe 't, dear lord,
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.

TIMON  Well mocked.

MERCHANT
No, my good lord. He speaks the common tongue,
Which all men speak with him.
