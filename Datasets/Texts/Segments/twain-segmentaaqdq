“Well,” said he, “I can't stand another three hours, I've had enough
today; I'll take a bed there.”

I asked:

“Are we nearly to the top?”

“Nearly to the TOP? Why, bless your soul, you haven't really started,
yet.”

I said we would put up at the inn, too. So we turned back and ordered a
hot supper, and had quite a jolly evening of it with this Englishman.
