My parts, my title, and my perfect soul
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

IAGO  By Janus, I think no.

OTHELLO
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant!
The goodness of the night upon you, friends.

And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
Even on the instant.

OTHELLO  What is the matter, think you?

CASSIO
Something from Cyprus, as I may divine.
