 I'll tell thee what, my friend,
He is a very serpent in my way,
And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
He lies before me. Dost thou understand me?
Thou art his keeper.

HUBERT  And I'll keep him so
That he shall not offend your Majesty.

KING JOHN
Death.

HUBERT  My lord?

KING JOHN  A grave.

HUBERT  He shall not live.

KING JOHN  Enough.
I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee.
Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee.
Remember. [He turns to Queen Eleanor.] Mada
