d-thirty,
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
in the reechy painting, sometimes like god Bel's
priests in the old church window, sometimes like
the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten
tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his
club?

CONRADE  All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears
out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the
fashion?
