alcontent,
He vails his tail that like a falling plume
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent.
He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
  His love, perceiving how he was enraged,
  Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.

His testy master goeth about to take him
When, lo, the unbacked breeder, full of fear,
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,
With her the horse, and left Adonis there.
  As they were mad unto the wood they hie them,
  Outstripping crows that strive
