that this is no time to lend money, especially upon
bare friendship, without security. Here's three solidares

FLAMINIUS

And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,
To him that worships thee!
[He throws the money back at Lucullus.]

LUCULLUS  Ha! Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy
master.	[Lucullus exits.]
