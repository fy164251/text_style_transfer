ws the old
rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of
the standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
tithing, and stocked, punished, and imprisoned;
who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to
his body,
	Horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
	But mice and rats and such small deer
	Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! Peace, thou
fiend!

GLOUCESTER, [to Lear]
What, hath your Grace no better company?
