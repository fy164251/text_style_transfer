uitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.

TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
Please you we may contrive this afternoon
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And do as adversaries do in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

GRUMIO and BIONDELLO
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

HORTENSIO
The motion's good indeed, and be it so.--
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
