as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
By the bad voice.

LORENZO  Dear lady, welcome home.

PORTIA
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,
Which speed we hope the better for our words.
Are they returned?

LORENZO  Madam, they are not yet,
But there is come a messenger before
To signify their coming.

PORTIA  Go in, Nerissa.
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence--
Nor you, Lorenzo--Jessica, nor you.
[A trumpet sounds.]

LORENZO
