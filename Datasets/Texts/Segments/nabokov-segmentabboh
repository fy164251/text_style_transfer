An ordinary iambic foot (i.e., one not affected by certain contractional and rhymal variations) consists of two semeia, the first semeion being called a depression and the second, an ictus ( or -). Any such foot belongs to one of the following types (where the basic metrical stress is marked thus-, and the variable word accent thus'):



Regular foot, (Unaccented non-stress followed by accented stress), e.g. "Appease my grief, and deadly pain" (Surrey)
