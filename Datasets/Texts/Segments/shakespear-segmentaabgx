is king.
Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
When Pistol lies, do this and fig me, like
The bragging Spaniard.	[Pistol makes a fig.]

FALSTAFF  What, is the old king dead?

PISTOL
As nail in door. The things I speak are just.

FALSTAFF  Away, Bardolph.--Saddle my horse.--
Master Robert Shallow, choose what office thou
wilt in the land, 'tis thine.--Pistol, I will double-charge
thee with dignities.

BARDOLPH  O joyful day! I would not take a knight-hood
for my fortune.
