t wake
	Do it for thy true love take.
	Love and languish for his sake.
	Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
	Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
	In thy eye that shall appear
	When thou wak'st, it is thy dear.
	Wake when some vile thing is near.	[He exits.]

[Enter Lysander and Hermia.]


LYSANDER
Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wood.
   And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way.
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
   And tarry for the comfort of the day.

HERMIA
