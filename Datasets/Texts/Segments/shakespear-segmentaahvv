 O heavens,
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
Allow obedience, if you yourselves are old,
Make it your cause. Send down and take my part.
[To Goneril.] Art not ashamed to look upon this
beard?	[Regan takes Goneril's hand.]
O Regan, will you take her by the hand?

GONERIL
Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?
All's not offense that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so.

LEAR  O sides, you are too tough!
Will you yet hold?--How came my man i' th'
stocks?
