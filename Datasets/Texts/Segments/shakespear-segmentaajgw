Sweet Portia, welcome.

PORTIA
So do I, my lord. They are entirely welcome.

LORENZO, [to Bassanio]
I thank your Honor. For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here,
But meeting with Salerio by the way,
He did entreat me past all saying nay
To come with him along.

SALERIO  I did, my lord,
And I have reason for it.	[Handing him a paper.]
Signior Antonio
Commends him to you.

BASSANIO  Ere I ope his letter,
I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.

SALERI
