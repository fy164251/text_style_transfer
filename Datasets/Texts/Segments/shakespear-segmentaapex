 dead at first, what needs a second striking?
  Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,
  To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!

Now which way shall she turn? What shall she say?
Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;
The time is spent; her object will away
And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.
  "Pity," she cries, "some favor, some remorse!"
  Away he springs and hasteth to his horse.

But, lo, from forth a copse that neighbors by,
A breeding jennet
