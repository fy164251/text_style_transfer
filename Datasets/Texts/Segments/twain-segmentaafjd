It was said that the old-time devotion to chiefs and reverence for their
persons still survive in the native commoner, and in great force.  The

gentlemen, but even his clothes cannot damn him in the reverence of his
people.  Their pride in his lofty rank and ancient lineage lives on, in
spite of his lost authority and the evil magic of his tailor.
