Philippi.

MESSALA
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.

BRUTUS  With what addition?

MESSALA
That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
Have put to death an hundred senators.

BRUTUS
Therein our letters do not well agree.
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

CASSIUS
Cicero one?

MESSALA  Cicero is dead,
And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
