
To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
That Talbot's name might be in thee revived
When sapless age and weak unable limbs
Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
But--O, malignant and ill-boding stars!--
Now thou art come unto a feast of Death,
A terrible and unavoided danger.
Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
By sudden flight. Come, dally not, be gone.

JOHN TALBOT
Is my name Talbot? And am I your son?
And shall I fly?
