To look that way thou wert.

LEONTES  Go on, go on.
Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitt'rest.

LORD, [to Paulina]  Say no more.
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
I' th' boldness of your speech.

PAULINA  I am sorry for 't.
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much
The rashness of a woman. He is touched
To th' noble heart.--What's gone and what's past
help
Should be past grief
