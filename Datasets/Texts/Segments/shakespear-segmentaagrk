[Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius,
Cinna, and Publius.]

And look where Publius is come to fetch me.

PUBLIUS
Good morrow, Caesar.

CAESAR  Welcome, Publius.--
What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?--
Good morrow, Casca.--Caius Ligarius,
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
As that same ague which hath made you lean.--
What is 't o'clock?

BRUTUS  Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.

CAESAR
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.

[Enter Antony.]

See, Anton
