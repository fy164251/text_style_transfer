words before thou giv'st them
breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.
For such things in a false, disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just,
They're close dilations working from the heart
That passion cannot rule.

IAGO  For Michael Cassio,
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

OTHELLO
I think so too.

IAGO  Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

OTHELLO  Certain, men should be what they seem.
