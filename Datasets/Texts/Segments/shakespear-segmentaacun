 charged
	   That one body should be filled
	With all graces wide-enlarged.
	   Nature presently distilled
	Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
	   Cleopatra's majesty,
	Atalanta's better part,
	   Sad Lucretia's modesty.
	Thus Rosalind of many parts
	   By heavenly synod was devised
	Of many faces, eyes, and hearts
	   To have the touches dearest prized.
	Heaven would that she these gifts should have
	And I to live and die her slave.
