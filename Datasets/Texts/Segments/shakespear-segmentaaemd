. Is she ready?

LADY  Ay,
To keep her chamber.

CLOTEN  There is gold for you.
Sell me your good report.	[He offers a purse.]

LADY
How, my good name? Or to report of you
What I shall think is good?

[Enter Imogen.]

The Princess.
[Lady exits.]

CLOTEN
Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.

IMOGEN
Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
And scarce can spare them.

CLOTEN
