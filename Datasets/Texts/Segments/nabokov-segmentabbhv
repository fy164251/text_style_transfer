cially in the Rocky Mountains states, the discovery of new species, and the description of some fantastic cases of adaptation. I think I could achieve a perfect blend of science, art and entertainment.

My wife and I have rented a beautiful little cottage here, in a strategic position between the Grand Canyon, Sion and Bryce National Parks. We plan to move to Maine in about two months: Dmitri has a singing engagement with the Arundel Company in Kennebunk Port.

Best regards from both of us.
