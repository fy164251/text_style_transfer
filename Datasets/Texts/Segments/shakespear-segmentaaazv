HOSTESS  Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets. I'll

PISTOL  Then, to you, Mistress Dorothy! I will charge

DOLL  Charge me? I scorn you, scurvy companion.

mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for
your master.

PISTOL  I know you, Mistress Dorothy.

DOLL  Away, you cutpurse rascal, you filthy bung, away!
