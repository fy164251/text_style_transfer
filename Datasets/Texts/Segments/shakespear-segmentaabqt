QUEEN MARGARET
No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.

KING HENRY
How now, what news? Why com'st thou in such
haste?

MESSENGER
The rebels are in Southwark. Fly, my lord!
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,
Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,
And calls your Grace usurper, openly,
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
His army is a ragged multitude
Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless.
Sir Humphrey Staf
