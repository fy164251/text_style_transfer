Dear Sir,

I thank you for your invitation to attend the lecture to be given at your Colleges by Mr. Ustinov of the Soviet Embassy, and the reception that will follow.

I never have attended, nor ever will attend, any function to which Soviet agents are invited.

Very truly yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
