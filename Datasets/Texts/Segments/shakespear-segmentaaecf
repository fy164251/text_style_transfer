FIRST SENATOR  The gods forbid!--
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
Leave us to cure this cause.

MENENIUS  For 'tis a sore upon us
You cannot tent yourself. Begone, beseech you.

COMINIUS  Come, sir, along with us.

CORIOLANUS
I would they were barbarians, as they are,
Though in Rome littered; not Romans, as they are
not,
Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol.

MENENIUS  Begone!
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
One time will owe another.

CORIOLANUS
