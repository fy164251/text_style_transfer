FLUTE, [as Thisbe]
O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans
   For parting my fair Pyramus and me.
My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,
   Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.

BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]
I see a voice! Now will I to the chink
   To spy an I can hear my Thisbe's face.
Thisbe?

FLUTE, [as Thisbe]
My love! Thou art my love, I think.

BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]
   Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace,
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.
