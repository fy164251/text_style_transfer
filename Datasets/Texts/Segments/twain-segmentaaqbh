 Mr. Lykins ... here
you are. And have you got it?”

“Well, not exactly GOT it, but the next thing to it. I've brought a
petition, signed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and all
the teachers, and by more than two hundred other people. Now I want you,
if you'll be so good, to go around with me to the Pacific delegation,
for I want to rush this thing through and get along home.”

“If the matter is so pressing, you will prefer that we visit the
delegation tonight,”
