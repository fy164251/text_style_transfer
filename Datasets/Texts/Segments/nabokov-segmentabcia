An additional request: Please do not release to the English publisher (George Weidenfeld) anything but the completely corrected page proofs of the novel. In this respect, an unfortunate misunderstanding regarding LOLITA resulted in the first British edition being riddled with misprints.

With most friendly greetings,





Yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
