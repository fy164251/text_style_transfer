ke a mirror
Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
I'll make my will, then, and as sick men do
Who know the world, see heaven but, feeling woe,
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
So I bequeath a happy peace to you
And all good men, as every prince should do;
My riches to the earth from whence they came,
[To the Daughter.] But my unspotted fire of love to
you.--
Thus ready for the way of life or death,
I wait the sharpest blow.
