er's. Shrew me
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any king's in Europe. I do think
I saw 't this morning. Confident I am
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kissed it.
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.

PISANIO  'Twill not be lost.

IMOGEN
I hope so. Go and search.	[Pisanio exits.]

CLOTEN  You have abused me.
"His meanest garment"?

IMOGEN  Ay, I said so, sir.
If you will make 't an action, call witness to 't.

CLOTEN
I will inform your father.
