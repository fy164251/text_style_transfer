REGAN  Hang him instantly.

GONERIL  Pluck out his eyes.

CORNWALL  Leave him to my displeasure.--Edmund,
keep you our sister company. The revenges we are
bound to take upon your traitorous father are not

bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift and
intelligent betwixt us.--Farewell, dear sister.--
Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.
