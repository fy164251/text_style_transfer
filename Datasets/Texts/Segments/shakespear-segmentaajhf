PORTIA
O love, dispatch all business and begone!

BASSANIO
Since I have your good leave to go away,
I will make haste. But till I come again,
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

Scene 3

[Enter Shylock, the Jew, and Solanio, and Antonio,
and the Jailer.]


SHYLOCK
Jailer, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Jailer, look to him.

ANTONIO  Hear me yet, good Shylock
