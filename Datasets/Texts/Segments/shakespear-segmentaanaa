ood
morrow, friends.--
Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
That old and antique song we heard last night.
Methought it did relieve my passion much,
More than light airs and recollected terms
Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.
Come, but one verse.

CURIO  He is not here, so please your Lordship, that
should sing it.

ORSINO  Who was it?

CURIO  Feste the jester, my lord, a Fool that the Lady
Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about
the house.
