 so am I for Phoebe.

PHOEBE  And I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO  And I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  And I for no woman.

SILVIUS
It is to be all made of fantasy,
All made of passion and all made of wishes,
All adoration, duty, and observance,
All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
All purity, all trial, all observance,
And so am I for Phoebe.

PHOEBE  And so am I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO  And so am I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  And so am I for no
woman.
