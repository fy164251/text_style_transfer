What's become of the wenching rogues? I think
they have swallowed one another. I would laugh at

Scene 5
=======
[Enter Diomedes and Servingman.]


DIOMEDES
Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
Present the fair steed to my Lady Cressid.
Fellow, commend my service to her beauty.
Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan
And am her knight by proof.

MAN  I go, my lord.	[He exits.]
