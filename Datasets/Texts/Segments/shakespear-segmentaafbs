ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there,
She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
That hath abused and dishonored me
Even in the strength and height of injury.
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

DUKE
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me
While she with harlots feasted in my house.

DUKE
A grievous fault.--
