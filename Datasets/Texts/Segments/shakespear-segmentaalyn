e me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know:
That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder.
If either of you both love Katherine,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

GREMIO
To cart her, rather. She's too rough for me.--
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?

KATHERINE, [to Baptista]
I pray you, sir, is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?

HORTENSIO
