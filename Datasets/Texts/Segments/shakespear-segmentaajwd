	Fled from her wish, and yet said "Now I may,"
	She that being angered, her revenge being nigh,
	Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
	She that in wisdom never was so frail
	To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail,
	She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
	See suitors following and not look behind,
	She was a wight, if ever such wight were--

DESDEMONA  To do what?

IAGO
	To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
