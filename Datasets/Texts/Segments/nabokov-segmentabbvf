 on LOLITA. There is in particular the case of the Italian producer, a Mr. Alberto Lattuada, whose picture will be called "The Little Nymph" and who tells reporters that it is an "adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel". The report appeared in several French papers (i.e. in the Figaro). The German paper Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung of Dec. 12th reports that "Nabokov's controversial novel LOLITA will, as it has been decided now, be filmed in Italy," by Alberto Lattuada etc.
