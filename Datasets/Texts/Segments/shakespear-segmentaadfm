 speaking honorably? Is
not marriage honorable in a beggar? Is not your
lord honorable without marriage? I think you
would have me say "Saving your reverence, a husband."
An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking,
I'll offend nobody. Is there any harm in "the heavier
for a husband"? None, I think, an it be the right
husband and the right wife. Otherwise, 'tis light and
not heavy. Ask my lady Beatrice else. Here she
comes.
