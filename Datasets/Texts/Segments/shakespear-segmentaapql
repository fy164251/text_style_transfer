take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office if they can but stay you
Where you'll be loath to be. Besides, you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

PERDITA  One of these is true.
I think affliction may subdue the cheek
But not take in the mind.

CAMILLO  Yea, say you so?
There shall not at your father's house these seven
years
Be born another such.

FLORIZELL  My good Camillo,
