IRD OUTLAW
No, we detest such vile base practices.
Come, go with us; we'll bring thee to our crews
And show thee all the treasure we have got,
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.

[Enter Proteus.]


PROTEUS
Already have I been false to Valentine,
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
Under the color of commending him,
I have access my own love to prefer.
But Sylvia is too fair, too true, too holy
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
