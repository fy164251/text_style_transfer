[Here they pinch him and sing about him, and Doctor
Caius comes one way and steals away a boy in white.
And Slender comes another way; he takes a boy in
green. And Fenton steals Mistress Anne Page.]


FAIRIES [sing]
	Fie on sinful fantasy!
	Fie on lust and luxury!
	Lust is but a bloody fire
	Kindled with unchaste desire,
	Fed in heart whose flames aspire
	As thoughts do blow them higher and higher.
	Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
	Pinch him for his villainy.
