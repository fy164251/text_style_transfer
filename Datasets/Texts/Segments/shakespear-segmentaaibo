g have incurred the worst.
For thee, oppressed king, I am cast down.
Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

LEAR
No, no, no, no. Come, let's away to prison.
We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.
When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down
And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news, and we'll talk
