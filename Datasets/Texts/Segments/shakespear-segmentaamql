 count.

VALENTINE  How painted? And how out of count?

SPEED  Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no
man counts of her beauty.

VALENTINE  How esteem'st thou me? I account of her
beauty.

SPEED  You never saw her since she was deformed.

VALENTINE  How long hath she been deformed?

SPEED  Ever since you loved her.

VALENTINE  I have loved her ever since I saw her, and
still I see her beautiful.

SPEED  If you love her, you cannot see her.

VALENTINE  Why?

SPEED
