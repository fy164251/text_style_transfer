vate collectors, I suggest that none of these would replace it by the kind of utilitarian trade edition mentioned above.

I would like you therefore to meet me halfway in this matter by allowing me to bring out the aforesaid trade edition (i.e., about one tenth of the whole book) in January 1961â€”although I actually see no reason why it should not appear simultaneously with the big opus.

I would very much appreciate if you could let me know what you think of this in the course of this week.
