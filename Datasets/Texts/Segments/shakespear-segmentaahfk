into armed gauntlets change,
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination.

DAUPHIN
There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace.
We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well.
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler.

PANDULPH  Give me leave to speak.

BASTARD
No, I will speak.

DAUPHIN  We will attend to neither.
Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here.

BASTARD
