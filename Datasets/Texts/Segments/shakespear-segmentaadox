oo.

CAESAR, [coming forward with Octavia]  No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still. The time shall not
Outgo my thinking on you.

ANTONY  Come, sir, come,
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love.
Look, here I have you, thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.

CAESAR  Adieu, be happy.

LEPIDUS, [to Antony]
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way.

CAESAR  Farewell, farewell.	[Kisses Octavia.]

ANTONY  Farewell.
