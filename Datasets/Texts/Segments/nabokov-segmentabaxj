 book, perhaps you would agree to the following three points:



If you contemplate an introduction I would like to be the one to write it;

A number of notes—explanations, comments and so on—would be appended by me for the scholarly reader;

For income tax reasons I might have to ask you to divide the total payment equally between 1950 and 1951.



I would also ask you then to send me a copy of the best available edition of the BROTHERS in Russian.

Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
