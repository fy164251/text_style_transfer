 loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgment in an honest face.
I prithee call him back.

OTHELLO  Went he hence now?

DESDEMONA  Yes, faith, so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

OTHELLO
Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.

DESDEMONA
But shall 't be shortly?

OTHELLO  The sooner, sweet, for you.

DESDEMONA
Shall 't be tonight at supper?

OTHELLO  No, not tonight.

DESDEMONA
