
KING RICHARD, [coming down]
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
[He embraces Bolingbroke.]
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
So be thy fortune in this royal fight.
Farewell, my blood--which, if today thou shed,
Lament we may but not revenge thee dead.

BOLINGBROKE
O, let no noble eye profane a tear
For me if I be gored with Mowbray's spear.
As confident as is the falcon's flight
Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight.
My loving lord, I take my leave of you.--
