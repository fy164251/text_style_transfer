 upon
Another's way of speech, when by mine own
I may be reasonably conceived--saved too,
Speaking it truly? Why am I bound
By any generous bond to follow him
Follows his tailor, haply so long until
The followed make pursuit? Or let me know
Why mine own barber is unblessed, with him
My poor chin too, for 'tis not scissored just
To such a favorite's glass? What canon is there
That does command my rapier from my hip
To dangle 't in my hand, or to go tiptoe
Before the street be foul? Ei
