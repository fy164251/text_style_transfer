r your royal birth,
Inferior to none but to his Majesty;
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
So kind a father of the commonweal,
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
We and our wives and children all will fight
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.

FIRST SERVINGMAN
Ay, and the very parings of our nails
Shall pitch a field when we are dead.
[Begin again.]

GLOUCESTER  Stay, stay, I say!
And if you love me, as you say you do,
Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
