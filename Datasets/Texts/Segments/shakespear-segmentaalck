KING EDWARD
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
To make the blessed period of this peace.

BUCKINGHAM  And in good time
Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the Duke.

[Enter Ratcliffe, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester.]


RICHARD
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen,
And, princely peers, a happy time of day.

KING EDWAR
