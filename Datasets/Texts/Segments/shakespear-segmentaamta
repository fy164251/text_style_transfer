Under a cloak that is of any length.

DUKE
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?

VALENTINE
Ay, my good lord.

DUKE  Then let me see thy cloak;
I'll get me one of such another length.

VALENTINE

DUKE
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
[Pulling off the cloak, he reveals
a rope ladder and a paper.]
What letter is this same? What's here? [(Reads.)] To
Sylvia.
