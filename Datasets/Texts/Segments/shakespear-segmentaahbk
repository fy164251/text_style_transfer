And in their rage, I having hold of both,
They whirl asunder and dismember me.
Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win.--
Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose.--
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine.--
Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive.
Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose.
Assured loss before the match be played.

DAUPHIN
Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.

BLANCHE
There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.

KING JOHN, [to Bastard]
