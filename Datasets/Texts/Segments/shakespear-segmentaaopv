 with us.

TRINCULO  Monster, I do smell all horse piss, at which
my nose is in great indignation.

STEPHANO  So is mine.--Do you hear, monster. If I
should take a displeasure against you, look you--

TRINCULO  Thou wert but a lost monster.

CALIBAN
Good my lord, give me thy favor still.
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance. Therefore speak
softly.
All's hushed as midnight yet.

TRINCULO  Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!

STEPHANO
