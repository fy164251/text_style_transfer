  These lily lips,
	      This cherry nose,
	   These yellow cowslip cheeks
	      Are gone, are gone!
	      Lovers, make moan;
	   His eyes were green as leeks.
	      O Sisters Three,
	      Come, come to me
	   With hands as pale as milk.
	      Lay them in gore,
	      Since you have shore
	   With shears his thread of silk.
	      Tongue, not a word!
	      Come, trusty sword,
	   Come, blade, my breast imbrue!
[Thisbe stabs herself.]
	      And farewell, friends.
