SOLDIER  Enobarbus, Antony
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
His bounty overplus. The messenger
Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
Unloading of his mules.

ENOBARBUS  I give it you.

SOLDIER  Mock not, Enobarbus.
I tell you true. Best you safed the bringer
Out of the host. I must attend mine office
Or would have done 't myself. Your emperor
Continues still a Jove.	[He exits.]

ENOBARBUS
I am alone the villain of the Earth,
And feel I am so most.
