surped.

RICHARD
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABETH  By nothing, for this is no oath.
Thy George, profaned, hath lost his lordly honor;
Thy Garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue;
Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.
If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,
Swear then by something that thou hast not
wronged.

RICHARD
Then, by myself--

QUEEN ELIZABETH  Thyself is self-misused.

RICHARD
Now, by the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH  'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
