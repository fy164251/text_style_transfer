for the time to come. This you may know
And so deliver: I am put to sea
With her who here I cannot hold on shore.
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
Concern me the reporting.

CAMILLO  O my lord,
I would your spirit were easier for advice
Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZELL  Hark, Perdita.--
I'll hear you by and by.
[Florizell and Perdita walk aside.]
