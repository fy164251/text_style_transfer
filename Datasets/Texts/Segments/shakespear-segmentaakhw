HAISA  The third, of Antioch;
And his device a wreath of chivalry;
The word: Me pompae provexit apex.

shield to Thaisa.]



SIMONIDES  What is the fourth?

THAISA
A burning torch that's turned upside down;
The word: Qui me alit me extinguit.

SIMONIDES
Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
