I need not repeat that we are very pleased with the book. I can only add that all those who saw it thought it wonderfulâ€”both the selection and the presentation.

I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Noyes for his letter of September 4. The three packages with the author's copies sent by surface mail arrived safely on October 2.





With VN's greetings and mine,

Sincerely yours,

(Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)
