ROSALINE
Not one word more, my maids. Break off, break off!
[The Ladies move away from the Lords.]

BEROWNE
By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

KING
Farewell, mad wenches. You have simple wits.
[King, Lords, and Blackamoors exit.]
[The Ladies unmask.]

PRINCESS
Twenty adieus, my frozen Muskovits.--
Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?

BOYET
   Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puffed
   out.

ROSALINE
Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
