 he live, we'll seek him out;
If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there,
And be resolved he lives to govern us,
Or dead, give 's cause to mourn his funeral
And leave us to our free election.

SECOND LORD
Whose death's indeed the strongest in our censure;
And knowing this kingdom is without a head--
Like goodly buildings left without a roof
Soon fall to ruin--your noble self,
That best know how to rule and how to reign,
We thus submit unto, our sovereign.

ALL  Live, noble Helic
