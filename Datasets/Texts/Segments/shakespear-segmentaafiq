

CONSTABLE  Ev'n as your horse bears your praises--
who would trot as well were some of your brags
dismounted.

DAUPHIN  Would I were able to load him with his
desert! Will it never be day? I will trot tomorrow a
mile, and my way shall be paved with English faces.

CONSTABLE  I will not say so for fear I should be faced
out of my way. But I would it were morning, for I
would fain be about the ears of the English.

RAMBURES  Who will go to hazard with me for twenty
prisoners?
