city strived
God Neptune's annual feast to keep, from whence
   Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
His banners sable, trimmed with rich expense,
   And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
In your supposing once more put your sight
   Of heavy Pericles. Think this his bark,
Where what is done in action--more, if might--
   Shall be discovered. Please you sit and hark.
