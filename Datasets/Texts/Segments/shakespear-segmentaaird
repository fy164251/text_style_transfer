I am bound
To enter publicly. Him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.

[Enter Provost, carrying a head.]


PROVOST
Here is the head. I'll carry it myself.

DUKE, [as Friar]
Convenient is it. Make a swift return,
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.

PROVOST  I'll make all speed.
[He exits.]

ISABELLA, [within]  Peace
