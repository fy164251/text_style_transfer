[Enter Captain Macmorris, and Captain Jamy.]


GOWER  Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain
Jamy, with him.

FLUELLEN  Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman,
that is certain, and of great expedition and
knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular
knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will
maintain his argument as well as any military man
in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars
of the Romans.

JAMY  I say gudday, Captain Fluellen.
