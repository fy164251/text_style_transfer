Come, Margaret. God, our hope, will succor us.

QUEEN MARGARET
My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.

KING HENRY, [to Saye]
Farewell, my lord. Trust not the Kentish rebels.

BUCKINGHAM
Trust nobody, for fear you be betrayed.

SAYE
The trust I have is in mine innocence,
And therefore am I bold and resolute.
