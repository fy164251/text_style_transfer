TROILUS
Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.--
Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
[Cressida, Diomedes, and Troilus exit.]

[Sound trumpet within.]

PARIS
Hark, Hector's trumpet.

AENEAS  How have we spent this
morning!
The Prince must think me tardy and remiss
That swore to ride before him to the field.

PARIS
'Tis Troilus' fault. Come, come to field with him.
