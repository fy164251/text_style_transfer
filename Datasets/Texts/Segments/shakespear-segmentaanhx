By their appointment. Some of Thebes have told 's

THESEUS
By th' helm of Mars, I saw them in the war,
Like to a pair of lions, smeared with prey,
Make lanes in troops aghast. I fixed my note

Worth a god's view. What prisoner was 't that told me
When I enquired their names?

Arcite and Palamon.
