her like thy sire nor dam,
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,
Marked by the Destinies to be avoided,
As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings.

RICHARD
Iron of Naples, hid with English gilt,
Whose father bears the title of a king,
As if a channel should be called the sea,
Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art
extraught,
To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart?

EDWARD
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
To make this shameless callet know herself.--
Helen of G
