 thou wert as I am and I a man,
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound!
  For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,
  Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee."

"Give me my hand," saith he. "Why dost thou feel it?"
"Give me my heart," saith she, "and thou shalt have it.
O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,
And being steeled, soft sighs can never grave it.
  Then love's deep groans I never shall regard
  Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard."
