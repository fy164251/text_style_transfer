es, great princes, barons, lords, and
knights,
For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.
Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon.
Go down upon him--you have power enough--
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
Bring him our prisoner.

CONSTABLE  This becomes the great!
Sorry am I his numbers are so
