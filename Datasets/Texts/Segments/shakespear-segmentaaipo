labored for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I
found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him

DUKE, [as Friar]  If his own life answer the straitness of

ESCALUS  I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE, [as Friar]  Peace be with you.
