ess she doth give demure good morrow
With soft slow tongue, true mark of modesty,
And sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow,
Forwhy her face wore sorrow's livery,
But durst not ask of her audaciously
  Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so,
  Nor why her fair cheeks over-washed with woe.

But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,
Each flower moistened like a melting eye,
Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy
Of those fair suns set
