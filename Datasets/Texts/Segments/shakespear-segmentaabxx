
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed--
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

[Alarum. Enter at one door a Son that hath killed his
Father, carrying the body.]


SON
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possessed with some store of crowns,
And I, that haply take them from him now,
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
Who's this?
