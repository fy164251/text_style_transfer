's Lane, along the roads, must come from the limited locality NÂ°. Mrs. Laughlin once saw me collecting there, and another time I pointed out these flowers to you on our way down. Melissa is well out and on the wane, little blue butterflies fluttering about that vetch, but nowhere else higher up. Annetta may be just emerging. It will be in full force towards the end of the month. You will do me a great favour if you can send me these plants (and a few ants)!

Sincerely yours V. Nabokov
