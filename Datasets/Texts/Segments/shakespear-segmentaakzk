 spits at him.)] Why dost
thou spit at me?

ANNE
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake.

RICHARD
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

ANNE
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.

RICHARD
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

ANNE
Would they were basilisks' to strike thee dead.

RICHARD
I would they were, that I might die at once,
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt
