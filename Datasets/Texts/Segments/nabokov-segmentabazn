ng of August though of course this varies with altitude, latitude etc. I have not quite made up my mind where I shall collect this summer. It will depend to some extent on the money my book—(CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE to be brought out by Harper on the 14th of this month—you may have seen parts of it in The New Yorker, Harper's Magazine or the Partisan) will bring me. It may also depend on what LIFE would decide to spend on this project.

Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
