do meet again, why we shall smile;
If not, why then this parting was well made.

CASSIUS
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.

BRUTUS
Why then, lead on.--O, that a man might know
The end of this day's business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
And then the end is known.--Come ho, away!
