ion cleared
Hereditary ours.

HERMIONE  By this we gather
You have tripped since.

POLIXENES  O my most sacred lady,
Temptations have since then been born to 's, for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes
Of my young playfellow.

HERMIONE  Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on.
Th' offenses we have made you do we'll answer,
If you first sinned with us, and that with us
