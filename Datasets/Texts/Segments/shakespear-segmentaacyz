
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
	Sweet lovers love the spring.

	And therefore take the present time,
	   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,
	For love is crowned with the prime,
	   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
	Sweet lovers love the spring.

TOUCHSTONE  Truly, young gentlemen, though there
was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was
very untunable.
