ver a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
nothing, for we may live to have need of such a
verse. We see it, we see it. How now, lambs?

TROILUS
Cressid, I love thee in so strained a purity
That the blest gods, as angry with my fancy--
More bright in zeal than the devotion which
Cold lips blow to their deities--take thee from me.

CRESSIDA  Have the gods envy?

PANDARUS  Ay, ay, ay, ay, 'tis too plain a case.

CRESSIDA
And is it true that I must go from Troy?

TROILUS
A hateful truth.
