nothing more than a simple verbal
“thank you;” and you were not even obliged by law to furnish that.
If you are coming up the street with a couple of baskets of apples in
your hands, and you meet a friend, you naturally invite him to take a
few.  That describes the condition of things in Virginia in the “flush
times.”  Every man had his pockets full of stock, and it was the actual
custom of the country to part with small quantities of it to friends
without the asking.
