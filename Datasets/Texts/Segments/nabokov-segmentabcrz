rger is "Gavrila Petrovich Kamenev (1772â€“1803), a wonderful poet in his own right" (mentioned in VN's EO). He also says that his new novel LATH4 has traversed the main mountain pass, and that "it will cause hacks to shy and asses to kick".

I look forward very much to your monograph on Anya when it is completed.

We both wish a very merry Christmas to you and your wife.





Sincerely,

(Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)
