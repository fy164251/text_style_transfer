hou art a fellow of a good respect;
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
Hold, then, my sword, and turn away thy face
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?

STRATO
Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.

BRUTUS
Farewell, good Strato.
[Brutus runs on his sword.]
Caesar, now be still.
I killed not thee with half so good a will.	[He dies.]

[Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala,
Lucilius, and the army.]


OCTAVIUS  What man is that?

MESSALA
