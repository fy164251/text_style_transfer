 you forgot me, sir?

TIMON
Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men.
Then, if thou grant'st thou 'rt a man, I have forgot
thee.

FLAVIUS  An honest poor servant of yours.

TIMON  Then I know thee not.
I never had honest man about me, I. All
I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains.

FLAVIUS  The gods are witness,
Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
[He weeps.]

TIMON
What, dost thou weep? Come nearer, then. I love
thee
