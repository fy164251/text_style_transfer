There my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy--
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew
As falcon doth the fowl--is yet a devil.
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO  The prenzie Angelo?

ISABELLA
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards
