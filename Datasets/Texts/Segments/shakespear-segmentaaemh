,
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler--not so eminent.

IMOGEN  Profane fellow,
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,
Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
Comparative for your virtues to be styled
The under-hangman of his kingdom and hated
For being preferred so well.

CLOTEN  The south fog rot him!

IMOGEN
He never can meet more mischance than come
To be but named
