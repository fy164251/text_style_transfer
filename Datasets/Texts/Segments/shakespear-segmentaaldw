BUCKINGHAM
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

RICHARD, [to Prince]
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

PRINCE
No, uncle, but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

RICHARD
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit;
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show,
