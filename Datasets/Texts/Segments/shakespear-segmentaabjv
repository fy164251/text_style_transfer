I humbly thank your royal Majesty.

HORNER
And I accept the combat willingly.

PETER  Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake pity
my case! The spite of man prevaileth against me. O
Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to
fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!

GLOUCESTER
Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hanged.

KING HENRY  Away with them to prison; and the day of
combat shall be the last of the next month.--
Come, Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.
