 wife is feeling well enough to travel. We shall be leaving in a few days. I am divided between a sense of utter exhaustion, after all the tasks of this spring, and an intolerable impatience to work on my new novel. I can promise you that by the very first week of August I will be studying your new version. We shall also discuss then the mysterious addenda which you say are not yet in the text.





With best greetings,

Vladimir Nabokov
