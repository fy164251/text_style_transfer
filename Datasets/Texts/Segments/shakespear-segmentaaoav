rninus be Rome's emperor.--
Andronicus, would thou were shipped to hell
Rather than rob me of the people's hearts.

LUCIUS
Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
That noble-minded Titus means to thee.

TITUS
Content thee, prince. I will restore to thee
The people's hearts and wean them from themselves.

BASSIANUS
Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
But honor thee, and will do till I die.
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
I will most thankful be, and thanks, to men
