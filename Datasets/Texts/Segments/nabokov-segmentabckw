 recently received from Prague three thick albums containing many of my things (including plays) collected by my mother in the twenties and thirties.

We have also made definite arrangements for the transfer of all our stuff stored in Ithaca from there to Montreux in October. I won der what Updike's reaction to some of the passages in your book will be. The albums and the material from Ithaca will be at your disposal when they will have been sorted out.

Cordial greetings from us both to you and
