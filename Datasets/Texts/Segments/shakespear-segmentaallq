ng equally of horse and foot;
Our archers shall be placed in the midst.
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
This, and Saint George to boot!--What think'st
thou, Norfolk?

NORFOLK
A good direction, warlike sovereign.
[He sheweth him a paper.]
This found I on my tent this morning.
