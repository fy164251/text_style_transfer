Friend Lancelet, what's the news?

LANCELET  An it shall please you to break up this, it
shall seem to signify.	[Handing him Jessica's letter.]

LORENZO
I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand,
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.

GRATIANO  Love news, in faith!

LANCELET  By your leave, sir.

LORENZO  Whither goest thou?

LANCELET  Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to
sup tonight with my new master the Christian.

LORENZO
