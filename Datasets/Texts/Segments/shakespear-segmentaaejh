They were parted
By gentlemen at hand.

QUEEN  I am very glad on 't.

IMOGEN
Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part
To draw upon an exile. O, brave sir!
I would they were in Afric both together,
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
The goer-back.--Why came you from your master?

PISANIO
On his command. He would not suffer me
To bring him to the haven, left these notes
Of what commands I should be subject to
When 't pleased you to employ me.

QUEEN, [to Imogen]
