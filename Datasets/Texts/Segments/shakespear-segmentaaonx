ur service, there resides
To make me slave to it, and for your sake
Am I this patient log-man.

MIRANDA  Do you love me?

FERDINAND
O heaven, O Earth, bear witness to this sound,
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true; if hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief. I,
Beyond all limit of what else i' th' world,
Do love, prize, honor you.

MIRANDA  I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of.

PROSPERO, [aside]  Fair encounter
Of two most rare affections.
