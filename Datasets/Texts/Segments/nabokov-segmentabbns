inton,

Please find enclosed a photostat of my agreement with Olympia and copy of some passages from a letter, referring to the question of copyright.

Incidentally, it might interest you to know that Obolensky had the legal situation analyzed by his lawyers whose opinion was that an arbitration would probably be necessary to make the abrogation of the agreement with Olympia "stick", and that such litigation might or might not be successful. I wish to avoid litigation if at all possible, althoug
