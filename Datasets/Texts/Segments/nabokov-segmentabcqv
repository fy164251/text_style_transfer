y publisher reach you? I did get the sumptuous Pound Era which you were so kind to send me.3 Though I detest Pound and the costume jewellery of his verse, I must say Kenner's approach is very interesting particularly when he discusses other writers of that era, and the real Chinese meaning of Uzura Pound's phony "Chinese."

Awaiting news from you, VÃ©ra and I send you and Pat our very best greetings.
