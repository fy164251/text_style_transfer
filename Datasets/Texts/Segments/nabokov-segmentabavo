orship actually represented in the book is imaginary, it deliberately displays features peculiar a) to nazism, b) to communism, c) to any dictatorial trends in an otherwise non-dictatorial order. It would be very easy for a biased translator to upset this balance. This, my husband believes, should be borne in mind when selecting the German translator. It would be even better, if the author could be given a chance to peruse the translation prior to publication.
