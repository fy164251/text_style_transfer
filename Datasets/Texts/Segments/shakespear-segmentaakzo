Arise, dissembler. Though I wish thy death,
I will not be thy executioner.

RICHARD, [rising]
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

ANNE
I have already.

RICHARD  That was in thy rage.
Speak it again and, even with the word,
This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
Shall for thy love kill a far truer love.
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.

ANNE  I would I knew thy heart.

RICHARD  'Tis figured in my tongue.

ANNE  I fear me both are false.
