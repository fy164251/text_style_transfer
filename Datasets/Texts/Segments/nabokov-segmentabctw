 176 pages to revise before I reach the end of the book: another month's work. I don't want to Chahinate,2 but today is January 15th and I strongly doubt that I shall finish before February 15th.

What takes up the most time is revamping a whole paragraph Chahine has botched or restoring one he has simply omitted, as well as redoing his French translations of poetry or fragments of poetry (those in Chapter 8, Part Two, for instance, just took up an entire day).

With best regards,

Vladimir Nabo
