let us in.
[All but Apemantus exit.]

[Enter two Lords.]


FIRST LORD  What time o' day is 't, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS  Time to be honest.

FIRST LORD  That time serves still.

APEMANTUS
The most accursed thou, that still omit'st it.

SECOND LORD  Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?

APEMANTUS
Ay, to see meat fill knaves, and wine heat fools.

SECOND LORD  Fare thee well, fare thee well.

APEMANTUS
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.

SECOND LORD  Why, Apemantus?
