ost narrator took us through the fog

Of a March night, where headlights from afar

Approached and grew like a dilating star,

To the green, indigo and tawny sea

Which we had visited in thirty-three,

Nine months before her birth. Now it was all

Pepper-and-salt, and hardly could recall

That first long ramble, the relentless light,

The flock of sails (one blue among the white

Clashed queerly with the sea, and two were red),

440 The man in the old blazer, crumbing bread,

The crowding gulls
