such a silly pass.

BIANCA
Fie, what a foolish duty call you this?

LUCENTIO
I would your duty were as foolish too.
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Hath cost me a hundred crowns since suppertime.

BIANCA
The more fool you for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO
Katherine, I charge thee tell these headstrong
women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

WIDOW
Come, come, you're mocking. We will have no
telling.

PETRUCHIO
Come on, I say, and first begin with her.
