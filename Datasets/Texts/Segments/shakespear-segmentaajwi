ic,
As honest as I am.

OTHELLO  Come. Let us to the castle.--
News, friends! Our wars are done. The Turks are
drowned.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?--
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus.
I have found great love amongst them. O, my sweet,
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
In mine own comforts.--I prithee, good Iago,
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.
Bring thou the master to the citadel.
He is a good one, and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect.-
