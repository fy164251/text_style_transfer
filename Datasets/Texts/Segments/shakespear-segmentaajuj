 thus beguiled your daughter of herself
And you of her, the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter,
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
Stood in your action.

BRABANTIO  Humbly I thank your Grace.
Here is the man--this Moor, whom now it seems
Your special mandate for the state affairs
Hath hither brought.

ALL  We are very sorry for 't.

DUKE, [to Othello]
What, in your own part, can you say to this?

BRABANTIO  Nothing, but this is so.

OT
