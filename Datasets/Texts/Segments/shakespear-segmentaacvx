Scene 4
=======
[Enter Rosalind, dressed as Ganymede, and Celia,
dressed as Aliena.]


ROSALIND  Never talk to me. I will weep.

CELIA  Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man.

ROSALIND  But have I not cause to weep?

CELIA  As good cause as one would desire. Therefore
weep.

ROSALIND  His very hair is of the dissembling color.

CELIA  Something browner than Judas's. Marry, his
kisses are Judas's own children.
