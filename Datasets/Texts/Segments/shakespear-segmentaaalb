he pursuers took him. At my tent
The Douglas is, and I beseech your Grace
I may dispose of him.

KING  With all my heart.

PRINCE
Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
This honorable bounty shall belong.
Go to the Douglas and deliver him
Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free.
His valors shown upon our crests today
Have taught us how to cherish such high deeds,
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.

LANCASTER
I thank your Grace for this high courtesy,
Which I shall give away
