pted and sworn.

Dennis Lafin, laborer. Have neither formed nor expressed an opinion.
Never had heard of the case. Believed in hangin' for them that deserved
it. Could read if it was necessary.

Mr. Braham objected. The man was evidently bloody minded. Challenged
peremptorily.

Larry O'Toole, contractor. A showily dressed man of the style known
as “vulgar genteel,” had a sharp eye and a ready tongue. Had read the
newspaper reports of the case, but they made no impression on him.
