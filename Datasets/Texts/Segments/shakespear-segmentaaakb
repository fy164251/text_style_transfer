Scene 3
=======
[The King enters with his power, crosses the stage and
exits. Alarum to the battle. Then enter Douglas, and Sir
Walter Blunt, disguised as the King.]


BLUNT, [as King]
What is thy name that in the battle thus
Thou crossest me? What honor dost thou seek
Upon my head?

DOUGLAS  Know then my name is Douglas,
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king.

BLUNT, [as King]  They tell thee true.

DOUGLAS
The Lord
