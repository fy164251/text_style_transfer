ok as "When Lilacs Last". If this chapter be added, then the parenthetic "Bishop to C2" on p. 219 should of course be deleted. I like this chapter XVI well enough but for some reasons I still hesitate to include it. However, as I say, your blurbist is free to fish out whatever he finds suitable. I would suggest making the blurb as prim and prosaic as possible: after all the reader will find out all about the author in the book itself.

Sincerely yours,
