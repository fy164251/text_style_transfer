Here comes Sir Oliver.--Sir Oliver Martext, you are
well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree,
or shall we go with you to your chapel?

OLIVER MARTEXT  Is there none here to give the
woman?

TOUCHSTONE  I will not take her on gift of any man.

OLIVER MARTEXT  Truly, she must be given, or the
marriage is not lawful.
