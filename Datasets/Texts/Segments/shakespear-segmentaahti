g, I love thee!

LEAR
Does any here know me? This is not Lear.
Does Lear walk thus, speak thus? Where are his
eyes?
Either his notion weakens, his discernings
Are lethargied--Ha! Waking? 'Tis not so.
Who is it that can tell me who I am?

FOOL  Lear's shadow.

LEAR
I would learn that, for, by the marks of
sovereignty,
Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded
I had daughters.

FOOL  Which they will make an obedient father.

LEAR  Your name, fair gentlewoman?
