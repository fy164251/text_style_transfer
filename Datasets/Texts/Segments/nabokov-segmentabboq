as not written us about it either. An adverse decision of the Court might prove very much to my husband's advantage since there seems to be a provision in the French law releasing the author if the publisher cannot continue to publish his book. We shall try to find out about the verdict. You may find it easier to do than it will be for us under the present circumstances. Please let us know in any case what you think of these suggestions.





Sincerely,

(Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)
