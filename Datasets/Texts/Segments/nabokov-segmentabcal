ill,

I am returning Miss Volochov's Index to Notes on Prosody to you (not to BW) as I think the thing should be retyped taking into account my drastic correctionsâ€”the deletion of all non-names, and then forwarded to BW. Yes, I would like to see the galley proofs.

The essay is so short, and the Table of Contents so informative, that the inclusion of "scuds", "tilts" etc. in its index is completely unnecessary. I am quite sure of this, and have deleted all references to them in Miss Volochov's
