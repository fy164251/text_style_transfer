es of the Parliament House!
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.--
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet.
I am thy sovereign.

YORK  I am thine.

EXETER
For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of
York.

YORK
It was my inheritance, as the earldom was.

EXETER
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.

WARWICK
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry.
