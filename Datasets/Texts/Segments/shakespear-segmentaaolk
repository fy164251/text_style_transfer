

FERDINAND, [seeing Miranda]  Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend!--Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island,
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here. My prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is--O you wonder!--
If you be maid or no.

MIRANDA  No wonder, sir,
But certainly a maid.

FERDINAND  My language! Heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

PROSPERO  How? The best?
