e I do conjure thee--
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
Are visibly charactered and engraved--
To lesson me and tell me some good mean
How with my honor I may undertake
A journey to my loving Proteus.

LUCETTA
Alas, the way is wearisome and long.

JULIA
A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
And when the flight is made to one so dear,
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
