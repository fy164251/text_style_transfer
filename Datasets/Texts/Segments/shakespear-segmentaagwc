e I perceive the fire?

TITINIUS
They are, my lord.

CASSIUS  Titinius, if thou lovest me,
Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
And here again, that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.

TITINIUS
I will be here again even with a thought.	[He exits.]

CASSIUS
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.
My sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius
And tell me what thou not'st about the field.
[Pindarus goes up.]
