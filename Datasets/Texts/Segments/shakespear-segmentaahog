   And trow you what he called me?

PRINCESS     Qualm, perhaps.

PRINCESS  Go, sickness as thou art!

PRINCESS
   And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.

KATHERINE
And Longaville was for my service born.

MARIA
   Dumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree.

BOYET
Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear.
