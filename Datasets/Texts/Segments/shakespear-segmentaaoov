nter Ariel, like a Harpy, claps
his wings upon the table, and with a quaint device the
banquet vanishes.]


ARIEL [as Harpy]
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
That hath to instrument this lower world
And what is in 't, the never-surfeited sea
Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island,
Where man doth not inhabit, you 'mongst men
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
And even with such-like valor, men hang and drown
Their proper selves.
[Alonso, Sebastian, and An
