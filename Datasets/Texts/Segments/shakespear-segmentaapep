beauty for the use,
Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear.
Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse;
  Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;
  Thou wast begot; to get, it is thy duty.

"Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,
Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
By law of nature thou art bound to breed,
That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;
  And so in spite of death thou dost survive,
  In that thy likeness still is left alive
