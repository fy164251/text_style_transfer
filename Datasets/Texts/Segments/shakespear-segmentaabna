naught but wail her darling's loss,
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimmed eyes
Look after him and cannot do him good,
So mighty are his vowed enemies.
His fortunes I will weep and, 'twixt each groan,
Say "Who's a traitor, Gloucester he is none."
[He exits, with Buckingham, Salisbury, Warwick,
and Others. Somerset steps aside.]

QUEEN MARGARET, [to Cardinal, Suffolk, and York]
Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot
beams.
