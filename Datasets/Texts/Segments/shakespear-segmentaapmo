Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant,
his innocent babe truly begotten; and the King shall
live without an heir if that which is lost be not
found.

LORDS
Now blessed be the great Apollo!

HERMIONE  Praised!

LEONTES  Hast thou read truth?

OFFICER
Ay, my lord, even so as it is here set down.

LEONTES
There is no truth at all i' th' oracle.
The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.
