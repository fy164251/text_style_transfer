[Enter Antony, Caesar; Octavia between them.]


ANTONY
The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom.

OCTAVIA  All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you.

ANTONY, [to Caesar]  Goodnight, sir.--My Octavia,
Read not my blemishes in the world's report.
I have not kept my square, but that to come
Shall all be done by th' rule. Good night, dear
lady.--
Good night, sir.

CAESAR  Goodnight.	[Caesar and Octavia exit
