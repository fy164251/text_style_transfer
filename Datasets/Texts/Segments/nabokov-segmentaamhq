I do notknow (being a complete non-athlete, whom the sports pages of a newspaperbore almost as much as does its kitchen section) what physical stress may beinvolved in serving one day a sequence of thirty-six aces at sea level andon the next soaring from a ski jump 136 meters through bright mountain air.Colossal, no doubt, and, perhaps, inconceivable. But I have managed totranscend the rack and the wrench of literary metamorphosis.
