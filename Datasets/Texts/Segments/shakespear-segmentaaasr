Upon my death, the French can little boast;
In yours they will; in you all hopes are lost.
Flight cannot stain the honor you have won,
But mine it will, that no exploit have done.
You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;
But if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.
There is no hope that ever I will stay
If the first hour I shrink and run away.	[He kneels.]
Here on my knee I beg mortality,
Rather than life preserved with infamy.

TALBOT
Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
