 joy is nothing else
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
In such a business.

FLORIZELL  I yield all this;
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business.

POLIXENES  Let him know 't.

FLORIZELL
He shall not.

POLIXENES  Prithee let him.

FLORIZELL  No, he must not.

SHEPHERD
Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice.

FLORIZELL  Come, come, he must not.
