Nay, I'll not warrant that, for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life.
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?

ISABELLA  Please you to do 't,
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO
Pleased you to do 't, at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA
That I do beg his life, if it be sin
