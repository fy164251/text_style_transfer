hee, or from Caesar's camp
Say "I am none of thine."

ANTONY  What sayest thou?

SOLDIER  Sir,
He is with Caesar.

EROS  Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.

ANTONY  Is he gone?

SOLDIER  Most certain.

ANTONY
Go, Eros, send his treasure after. Do it.
Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him--
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings.
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men. Dispatch.--Enobarb
