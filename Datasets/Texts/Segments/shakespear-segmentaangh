Stand up.

EMILIA, [to Third Queen]  No knees to me.
What woman I may stead that is distressed
Does bind me to her.

THESEUS, [to First Queen]
What's your request? Deliver you for all.

FIRST QUEEN
We are three queens whose sovereigns fell before
The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured
The beaks of ravens, talons of the kites,
And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.
He will not suffer us to burn their bones,
To urn their ashes, nor to take th' offense
Of mortal loathsomene
