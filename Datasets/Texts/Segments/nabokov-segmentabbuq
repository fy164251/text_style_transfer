 write us in care of V.'s sister, Mme Hélène Sikorski, Palais des Nations, Bibliothèque, Genève. Is there any chance of Morris's joining Alisons later?

It was nice of you to think of the Retirement Fund matter. We have written Mineka.

We hope to see Alison in the near future, and preferably both of you.

Love from us both to you both.
