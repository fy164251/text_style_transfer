 taken to the “pulsators” and there reduced to
a quarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand.  Then I followed it
to the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly spread it out
and brush it about and seize the diamonds as they showed up.  I assisted,
and once I found a diamond half as large as an almond.  It is an exciting
kind of fishing, and you feel a fine thrill of pleasure every time you
detect the glow of one of those limpid pebbles through the veil of dark
sand.
