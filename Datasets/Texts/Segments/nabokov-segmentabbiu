Dear Jason,

Thanks for sending the LOLITA excerpts and the Dupee article. At first glance, it all looks fine. I shall devote more time to this matter during the Thanksgiving vacation. You will have it all back early next week.

Would the $400 honorarium cover both excerpts and article? If so, I would accept $200
