PRINCE  Thou liest. Thou art not colted; thou art
uncolted.

FALSTAFF  I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my
horse, good king's son.

PRINCE  Out, you rogue! Shall I be your ostler?

FALSTAFF  Hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I have
not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison--when a jest
is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.
