PORTER'S MAN
Pray, sir, be patient. 'Tis as much impossible--
Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--
To scatter 'em as 'tis to make 'em sleep
On May Day morning, which will never be.
We may as well push against Paul's as stir 'em.

PORTER  How got they in, and be hanged?

PORTER'S MAN
Alas, I know not. How gets the tide in?
As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--
You see the poor remainder--could distribute,
I made no spare, sir.

PORTER  You did nothing, sir.
