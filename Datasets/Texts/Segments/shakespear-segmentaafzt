u, my good lord mayor
And you, good brethren, I am much beholding.
I have received much honor by your presence,
And you shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords.
You must all see the Queen, and she must thank you;
She will be sick else. This day, no man think
'Has business at his house, for all shall stay.
This little one shall make it holiday.
