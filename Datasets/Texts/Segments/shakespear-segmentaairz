 head, condemned by Angelo.
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger--

LUCIO, [to Duke]  That's I, an 't like your Grace.
I came to her from Claudio and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

ISABELLA, [to Duke]  That's he indeed.

DUKE, [to Lucio]
You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO  No, my good lord,
Nor wished to hold my peace.

DUKE  I wish you now, then.
Pray you take note
