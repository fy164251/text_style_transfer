[Enter Pandarus and Troilus.]


TROILUS
Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again.
Why should I war without the walls of Troy
That find such cruel battle here within?
Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none.

PANDARUS  Will this gear ne'er be mended?

TROILUS

Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;
But I am weaker
