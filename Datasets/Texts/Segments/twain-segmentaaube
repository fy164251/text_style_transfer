there to comfort her. She soliloquized:

“Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got

Presently she stopped, and said to herself:

“It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say
that--I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll
never, never, never see him any more.”
