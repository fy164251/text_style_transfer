iver vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess. Pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend. We are much out o' th'
way.

By whom shall I send this?--Company? Stay.
[He steps aside.]

[Enter Dumaine, with a paper.]


BEROWNE, [aside]
All hid, all hid--an old infant play.
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky,
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
More sacks to the mill. O heavens, I have my wish.
Dumaine transformed! Four woodcocks in a dish.
