Theatre. In my painfree moments I have been re-reading a number of Russian plays. Unfortunately, all those that are worth translating are in verse (Griboedov, Pushkin, Lermontov, Blok), a fact I had entirely overlooked. This project will have to be shelvedâ€”for the time being at least.





Language book. I am afraid, this project does not interest me as I am interested in literary matters only. Thank you, anyway, for asking me. It sounds very good, but I just don't have the time for this
