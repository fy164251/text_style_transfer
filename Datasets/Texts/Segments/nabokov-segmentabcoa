to know what satisfaction and delight your English edition of my father's The Provisional Government gave me. Besides obvious filial feelings I also experienced deep gratification at seeing historical truth so authoritatively presented at a time when totalitarian politics are allowed to invade a great part of the globe. The worth of the publication is enhanced by its being brought out by the press of a great university.





Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
