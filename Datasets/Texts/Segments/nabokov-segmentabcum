d not soljournaleseâ€”but romantic and precise Russian, and if I cannot find a docile assistant I will do the job all by myself, like Pushkin's Missail.1

I was both perplexed and amused by the nonsense somebody called Poirier wrote about the "prototype" of my Oxman2 (not having read The Island of Dr. Moreau,3 and not realizing that I never met the poet Oxsoup or Otsup in my life). Your joining the fray by introducing an innocent old Pushkinist amused me still more.





Cordially yours,
