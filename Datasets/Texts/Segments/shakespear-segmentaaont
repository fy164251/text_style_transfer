MIRANDA  If you'll sit down,
I'll bear your logs the while. Pray, give me that.
I'll carry it to the pile.

FERDINAND  No, precious creature,
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonor undergo
While I sit lazy by.

MIRANDA  It would become me
As well as it does you, and I should do it
With much more ease, for my good will is to it,
And yours it is against.

PROSPERO, [aside]  Poor worm, thou art infected.
This visitation shows it.
