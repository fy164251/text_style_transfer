ABELLA
Hark how I'll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO  How? Bribe me?

ISABELLA
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]  You had marred all else.

ISABELLA
Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rate are either rich or poor
As fancy values them, but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sunrise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing tem
