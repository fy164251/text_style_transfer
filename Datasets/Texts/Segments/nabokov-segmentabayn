Time is passing, and I still have not seen either blurb, jacket or binding. Who is designing the jacket? I trust there is no "Russian" stuff—churches, pagodas, samovars—being considered. I am raising this question only because I have had something of the sort inflicted upon me by an English publisher.

What are you doing in the way of publicity? Santa Claus
