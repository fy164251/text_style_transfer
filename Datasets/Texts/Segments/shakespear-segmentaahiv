BEROWNE, [to Rosaline]  Lady, I will commend you to
my own heart.

ROSALINE  Pray you, do my commendations. I would
be glad to see it.

BEROWNE  I would you heard it groan.

ROSALINE  Is the fool sick?

BEROWNE  Sick at the heart.

ROSALINE  Alack, let it blood.

BEROWNE  Would that do it good?

ROSALINE  My physic says "ay."

BEROWNE
