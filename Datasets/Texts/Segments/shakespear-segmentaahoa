BEROWNE, [to the Princess]
White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

PRINCESS, [speaking as Rosaline]
Honey, and milk, and sugar--there is three.

BEROWNE
Nay then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey. Well run, dice!
There's half a dozen sweets.

PRINCESS  Seventh sweet, adieu.
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

BEROWNE
One word in secret.

PRINCESS  Let it not be sweet.

BEROWNE
Thou grievest my gall.
