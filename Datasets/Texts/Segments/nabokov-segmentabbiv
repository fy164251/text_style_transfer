 for the excerpts and $200 (or more) for the article.1 I am writing to Paris to make sure that they won't mind my signing the agreement with the Anchor Review for the reprint of the LOLITA pieces. I think it will be all right and you can prepare the agreement. Send me an extra copy, if possible, so that I can send it to my agent for Olympia.

The two PNIN notes will also be returned to you within a few days now. It is a pity I cannot come to New York at this time. I shall regret having missed me
