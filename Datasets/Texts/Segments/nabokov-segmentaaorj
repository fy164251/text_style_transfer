n my student days. The following lines opening this poem, which is entitled “Art,” pleased me by their catchy lilt and jarred upon the religious sentiments instilled in me by our very “high” Zemblan church.

From mammoth hunts and Odysseys

And Oriental charms

To the Italian goddesses

With Flemish babes in arms.





Line 962: Help me, Will. Pale Fire.


Paraphrased, this evidently means: Let me look in Shakespeare for something I might use for a title. And the find is “pale fire.”
