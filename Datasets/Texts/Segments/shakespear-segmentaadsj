unds and kiss
The honored gashes whole.

[Enter Cleopatra.]

[To Scarus.] Give me thy hand.
To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
Make her thanks bless thee.--O, thou day o' th'
world,
Chain mine armed neck. Leap thou, attire and all,
Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
Ride on the pants triumphing.

CLEOPATRA  Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
The world's great snare uncaught?

ANTONY  Mine nightingale,
We have beat them to their beds.
