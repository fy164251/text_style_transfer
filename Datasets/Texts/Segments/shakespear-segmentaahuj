 he shall never more
Be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose,
How in my strength you please.--For you, Edmund,
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself, you shall be ours.
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need.
You we first seize on.

EDMUND  I shall serve you, sir,
Truly, however else.

GLOUCESTER  For him I thank your Grace.

CORNWALL
You know not why we came to visit you--

REGAN
Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night.
