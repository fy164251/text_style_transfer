LOVELL
The reformation of our traveled gallants
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.

CHAMBERLAIN
I'm glad 'tis there; now I would pray our monsieurs
To think an English courtier may be wise
And never see the Louvre.

LOVELL  They must either--
For so run the conditions--leave those remnants
Of fool and feather that they got in France,
With all their honorable points of ignorance
Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,
Abusing better men than they can be
O
