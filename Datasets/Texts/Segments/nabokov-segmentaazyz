my Speak, Memory will recognize many details of the final section of chapter 9, Speak, Memory, Putnam’s, New York, 1966. Amid the mosaic of fiction there are some real memories not represented in Speak, Memory, such as the passages about the teacher “Berezovski” (Berezin, a popular geographer of the day), including the fight with the school bully. The place is St. Petersburg, the time around 1910.
