d are no fairy
Motion? Well, speak on. Where were you born?
And wherefore called Marina?

MARINA  Called Marina
For I was born at sea.

PERICLES  At sea? What mother?

MARINA
My mother was the daughter of a king,
Who died the minute I was born,
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
Delivered weeping.

PERICLES  O, stop there a little!
[Aside.] This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
Did mock sad fools withal. This cannot be
My daughter, buried.--Well, where were you bred?
