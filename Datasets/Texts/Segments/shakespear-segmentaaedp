away!
He's banished, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS
Hear me, my masters and my common friends--

SICINIUS
He's sentenced. No more hearing.

COMINIUS  Let me speak.
I have been consul and can show for Rome
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
My country's good with a respect more tender,
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
And treasure of my loins. Then if I would
Speak that--

SICINIUS  We know your drift. Speak what?
