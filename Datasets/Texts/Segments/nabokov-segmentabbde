Dear Mr. Brockway,

I have finished working on Part One of ANNA KARENIN1 and am having the thing typed. It will be in your hands before the end of the month.

There will be ninety six notes of varying length; and I have corrected the numerous blunders in Garnett's text. I have also finished the foreword for Part One and a brief expose of the main introduction.2

Thank y
