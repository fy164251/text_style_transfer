n their smells alone,
	   But in their hue;
	Maiden pinks, of odor faint,
	Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,
	   And sweet thyme true;
	Primrose, firstborn child of Ver,
	Merry springtime's harbinger,
	   With her bells dim;
	Oxlips in their cradles growing,
	Marigolds on deathbeds blowing,
	   Lark's-heels trim;
	All dear Nature's children sweet
	Lie 'fore bride and bridegroom's feet,
[Strew flowers.]
	   Blessing their sense.
	Not an angel of the air,
	Bird melodious or bird
