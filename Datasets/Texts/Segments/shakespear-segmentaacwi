ts can show her.--
But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love,
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.--
So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.

PHOEBE
Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together.
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
