 at door for you.

FALSTAFF, [to Page]  Pay the musicians, sirrah.--
Farewell, hostess.--Farewell, Doll. You see, my
good wenches, how men of merit are sought after.
The undeserver may sleep when the man of action
is called on. Farewell, good wenches. If I be not sent
away post, I will see you again ere I go.

DOLL  I cannot speak. If my heart be not ready to
burst--well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.

FALSTAFF  Farewell, farewell.
[He exits with Bardolph, Page, and Musicians.
