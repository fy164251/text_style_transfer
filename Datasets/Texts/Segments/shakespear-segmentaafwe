Scene 1
=======
[Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another, the First
Gentleman carrying a paper.]


FIRST GENTLEMAN
You're well met once again.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  So are you.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
You come to take your stand here and behold
The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?

SECOND GENTLEMAN
'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
'Tis very true. But that time offered sorrow,
This general joy.
