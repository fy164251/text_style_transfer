What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find
They are inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN  Please you, sir,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it.
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.

ANTONIO  We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

ALONSO  Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
[Alonso sleeps. Ariel exits.]

SEBASTIAN
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANTONI
