SOLDIER  Jack Cade, Jack Cade!

CADE  Knock him down there.	[They kill him.]

DICK  If this fellow be wise, he'll never call you Jack
Cade more. I think he hath a very fair warning.
[Takes a paper from the dead Soldier and
reads the message.]
My lord, there's an army gathered together in
Smithfield.

CADE  Come, then, let's go fight with them. But first, go
and set London Bridge on fire, and, if you can,
burn down the Tower too. Come, let's away.
[All exit.]
