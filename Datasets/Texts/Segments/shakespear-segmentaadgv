This wedding day
   Perhaps is but prolonged. Have patience and
   endure.
[All but Beatrice and Benedick exit.]

BENEDICK  Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?

BEATRICE  Yea, and I will weep a while longer.

BENEDICK  I will not desire that.

BEATRICE  You have no reason. I do it freely.

BENEDICK  Surely I do believe your fair cousin is
wronged.

BEATRICE  Ah, how much might the man deserve of me
that would right her!

BENEDICK  Is there any way to show such friends
