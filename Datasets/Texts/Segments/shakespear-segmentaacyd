 then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to
be a man.

ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  So I do; but, i' faith, I should
have been a woman by right.

CELIA, [as Aliena]  Come, you look paler and paler. Pray
you draw homewards.--Good sir, go with us.

OLIVER
That will I, for I must bear answer back
How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.

ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I shall devise something.
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.
Will you go?
[They exit.]
