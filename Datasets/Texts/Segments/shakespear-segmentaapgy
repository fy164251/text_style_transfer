im seen no more,
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend;
  So did the merciless and pitchy night
  Fold in the object that did feed her sight;

Whereat amazed, as one that unaware
Hath dropped a precious jewel in the flood,
Or stonished, as night wand'rers often are,
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,
  Even so confounded in the dark she lay,
  Having lost the fair discovery of her way.

And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,
That all the neighbor caves,
