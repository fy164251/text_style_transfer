
O Antony, O thou Arabian bird!

ENOBARBUS
Would you praise Caesar, say "Caesar." Go no
further.

AGRIPPA
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

ENOBARBUS
But he loves Caesar best, yet he loves Antony.
Hoo, hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets,
cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number--hoo!--
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA  Both he loves.

ENOBARBUS
They are his shards and he their beetle.
