as is her picture
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES  Good madam--

PAULINA  I have done.
Yet if my lord will marry--if you will, sir,
No remedy but you will--give me the office
To choose you a queen. She shall not be so young
As was your former, but she shall be such
As, walked your first queen's ghost, it should take
joy
To see her in your arms.

LEONTES  My true Paulina,
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.

PAULINA  That
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath,
Never
