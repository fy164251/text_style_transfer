 aside, I
had lied in my throat if I had said so.

SERVANT  I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and
your soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you,
you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than
an honest man.

FALSTAFF  I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that
which grows to me? If thou gett'st any leave of me,
hang me; if thou tak'st leave, thou wert better be
hanged. You hunt counter. Hence! Avaunt!

SERVANT  Sir, my lord would speak with you.
