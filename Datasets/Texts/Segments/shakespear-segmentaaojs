your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

BOATSWAIN  Work you, then.

ANTONIO  Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent
noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than
thou art.

GONZALO  I'll warrant him for drowning, though the
ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky
as an unstanched wench.

BOATSWAIN  Lay her ahold, ahold! Set her two courses.
Off to sea again! Lay her off!

[Enter more Mariners, wet.]


MARINERS  All lost! To prayers, to prayers
