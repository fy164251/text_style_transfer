 me some help!
[As Servants hold the chair, Cornwall forces out
one of Gloucester's eyes.]
O cruel! O you gods!

REGAN

CORNWALL
If you see vengeance--

FIRST SERVANT  Hold your hand,
my lord.
I have served you ever since I was a child,
But better service have I never done you
Than now to bid you hold.

REGAN  How now, you dog?

FIRST SERVANT
If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
