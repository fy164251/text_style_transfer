[They exit. The Abbot of Westminster, the Bishop of
Carlisle, Aumerle remain.]

ABBOT
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.

CARLISLE
The woe's to come. The children yet unborn
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.

AUMERLE
You holy clergymen, is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?

ABBOT  My lord,
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
