
ALCIBIADES  Then there's my glove.
Descend and open your uncharged ports.
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Fall, and no more. And to atone your fears
With my more noble meaning, not a man
Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
Of regular justice in your city's bounds
But shall be remedied to your public laws
At heaviest answer.

BOTH  'Tis most nobly spoken.

ALCIBIADES  Descend and keep your words.
[The Senators descend.]
