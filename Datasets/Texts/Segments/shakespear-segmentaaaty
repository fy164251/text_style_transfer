 underneath her wings.
Yet if this servile usage once offend,
Go and be free again as Suffolk's friend.
[She is going.]
O, stay! [(Aside.)] I have no power to let her pass.
My hand would free her, but my heart says no.
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
Twinkling another counterfeited beam,
So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak.
I'll call for pen and ink and write my mind.
Fie, de la Pole, disable not thyself!
Hast not a tongue?
