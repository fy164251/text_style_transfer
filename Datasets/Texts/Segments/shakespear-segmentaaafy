med to the harp
Many an English ditty lovely well
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament--
A virtue that was never seen in you.

HOTSPUR
Marry, and I am glad of it with all my heart.
I had rather be a kitten and cry "mew"
Than one of these same meter balladmongers.
I had rather hear a brazen can'stick turned,
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree,
And that would set my teeth nothing an edge,
Nothing so much as mincing poetry.
'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
