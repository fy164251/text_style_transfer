So she, deep drenched in a sea of care,
Holds disputation with each thing she views
And to herself all sorrow doth compare;

And as one shifts, another straight ensues.

The little birds that tune their morning's joy
Make her moans mad with their sweet melody,
For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;
