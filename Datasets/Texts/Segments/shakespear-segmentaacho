ee mercy for 't.

LAFEW  Good faith, across.
But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cured
Of your infirmity?

KING  No.

LAFEW  O, will you eat
No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
Could reach them. I have seen a medicine
That's able to breathe life into a stone,
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch
Is powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,
To give great Charlemagne a pen in 's hand
