ou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood.
Join with the present sickness that I have,
And thy unkindness be like crooked age
To crop at once a too-long withered flower.
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!--
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave.
Love they to live that love and honor have.
[He exits, carried off by Attendants.]

KING RICHARD
And let them die that age and sullens have,
For both hast thou, and both become the grave.
