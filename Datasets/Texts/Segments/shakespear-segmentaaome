and the fair soul herself
Weighed between loathness and obedience at
Which end o' th' beam should bow. We have lost
your son,
I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them.
The fault's your own.

ALONSO  So is the dear'st o' th' loss.

GONZALO  My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in. You rub the sore
When you should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN  Very well.
