PROTEUS
No, but she is an earthly paragon.

VALENTINE
Call her divine.

PROTEUS  I will not flatter her.

VALENTINE
O, flatter me, for love delights in praises.

PROTEUS
When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
And I must minister the like to you.

VALENTINE
Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
Yet let her be a principality,
Sovereign to all the creatures on the Earth.

PROTEUS
Except my mistress.

VALENTINE  Sweet, except not any,
Except thou wilt except agains
