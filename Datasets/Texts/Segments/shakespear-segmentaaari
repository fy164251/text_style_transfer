' Duke of Burgundy.
[He hands the King a paper.]

TALBOT
Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
I vowed, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg,
[tearing it off]
Which I have done, because unworthily
Thou wast installed in that high degree.--
Pardon me, princely Henry and the rest.
This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
When but in all I was six thousand strong
And that the French were almost ten to one,
Before we met or that a stroke was g
