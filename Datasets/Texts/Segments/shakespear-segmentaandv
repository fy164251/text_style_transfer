TOBY, [seizing Sebastian]  Come on, sir, hold!

ANDREW  Nay, let him alone. I'll go another way to
work with him. I'll have an action of battery against
him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck
him first, yet it's no matter for that.

SEBASTIAN, [to Toby]  Let go thy hand!

TOBY  Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
soldier, put up your iron. You are well fleshed.
Come on.
