aising,
Nothing but his report.

MESSENGER  Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded, and more,
More fearful, is delivered.

SICINIUS  What more fearful?

MESSENGER
It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
How probable I do not know--that Martius,
Joined with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS  This is most likely!

BRUTUS
Raised only that the weaker sort may wish
Good Martius home again.
