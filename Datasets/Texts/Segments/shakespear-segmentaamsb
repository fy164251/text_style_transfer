 fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.

SPEED  I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.

LANCE  Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn
himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the
alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not
worth the name of a Christian.

SPEED  Why?

LANCE  Because thou hast not so much charity in thee
as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?

SPEED  At thy service.
