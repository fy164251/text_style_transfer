EDWARD
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.

WARWICK
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
The next degree is England's royal throne:
For King of England shalt thou be proclaimed
In every borough as we pass along,
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Stay we no longer dreaming of
