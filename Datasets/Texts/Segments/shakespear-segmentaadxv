evailed you?

MARTIUS
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

COMINIUS
Martius, we have at disadvantage fought
And did retire to win our purpose.

MARTIUS
How lies their battle? Know you on which side
They have placed their men of trust?

COMINIUS  As I guess,
Martius,
Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.
