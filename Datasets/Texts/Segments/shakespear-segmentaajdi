Scene 2
=======
[Enter Lancelet Gobbo the Clown, alone.]


LANCELET  Certainly my conscience will serve me to
run from this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine
elbow and tempts me, saying to me "Gobbo,
Lancelet Gobbo, good Lancelet," or "good Gobbo,"
or "good Lancelet Gobbo, use your legs, take
the start, run away." My conscience says "No. Take
heed, honest Lancelet, take heed, honest Gobbo,"
or, as aforesaid, "honest Lancelet Gobbo, do not
run; scorn running with thy heels.
