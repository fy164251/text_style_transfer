LANCELET  Do you not know me, father?

GOBBO  Alack, sir, I am sandblind. I know you not.

LANCELET  Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might
fail of the knowing me. It is a wise father that
knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you
news of your son. [He kneels.] Give me your blessing.
Truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid
long--a man's son may, but in the end, truth will
out.

GOBBO  Pray you, sir, stand up! I am sure you are not
Lancelet my boy.
