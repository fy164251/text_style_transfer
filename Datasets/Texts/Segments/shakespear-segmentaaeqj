distressed, appears he hath had
Good ancestors.

ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  How angel-like he sings!

GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters
And sauced our broths as Juno had been sick
And he her dieter.

ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Nobly he yokes
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
Was that it was for not being such a smile,
The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
From so divine a temple to commix
With winds that sailors rail at.

GUIDERIUS
