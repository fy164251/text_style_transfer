Dear Katharine,

Thanks for the proof1 and the chubby check. It is nice to know that Andy is out of the hospital.

I have cheerfully agreed to accept some thirty minor alterations, and have attended to some other details you wanted cleared up; but a few items I cannot accept, especially: 7 + 8 (explanation), 11 + 11a (transition), 19 (the head! Pnin's head!), 25 (the squirrelized tree),
