that the devil
drives.

COUNTESS  Is this all your Worship's reason?

FOOL  Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such
as they are.

COUNTESS  May the world know them?

FOOL  I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you
and all flesh and blood are, and indeed I do marry
that I may repent.

COUNTESS  Thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness.

FOOL  I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have
friends for my wife's sake.

COUNTESS  Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
