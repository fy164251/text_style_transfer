 but mean-appareled.

BAPTISTA
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIONDELLO  Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA  Didst thou not say he comes?

BIONDELLO  Who? That Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA  Ay, that Petruchio came!

BIONDELLO  No, sir, I say his horse comes with him on
his back.

BAPTISTA  Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO
	Nay, by Saint Jamy.
	I hold you a penny,
	A horse and a man
	Is more than one,
	And yet not many.

[Enter Petruchio and Grumio.]
