easier for you I agreed (very much against my better judgment since in my opinion it detracts from the value of the book) to take out the two appendixes. But I would be extremely sorry if you insisted on sharing in the trade edition for this would make it impossible for me to sign an agreement with the Press.





Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
