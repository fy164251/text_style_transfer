 You have prayed well today.
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
[Sound still with the shouts.]

SICINIUS, [to Second Messenger]  First, the gods bless
you for your tidings; next, accept my thankfulness.

SECOND MESSENGER
Sir, we have all great cause to give great thanks.

SICINIUS  They are near the city?

SECOND MESSENGER  Almost at point to enter.

SICINIUS  We'll meet them, and help the joy.
[They exit.]
