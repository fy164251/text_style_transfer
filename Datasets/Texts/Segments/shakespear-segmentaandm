ANTONIO
I must obey. [To Viola.] This comes with seeking
you.
But there's no remedy. I shall answer it.
What will you do, now my necessity
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
Much more for what I cannot do for you
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,
But be of comfort.

SECOND OFFICER  Come, sir, away.

ANTONIO, [to Viola]
I must entreat of you some of that money.

VIOLA  What money, sir?
For the fair kindness you have showed me here,
And part being prompted
