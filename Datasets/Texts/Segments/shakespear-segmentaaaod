ight,
And his achievements of no less account.
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
To give their censure of these rare reports.

[Enter Messenger and Talbot.]


MESSENGER
Madam, according as your Ladyship desired,
By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.

COUNTESS
And he is welcome. What, is this the man?

MESSENGER
Madam, it is.

COUNTESS  Is this the scourge of France?
Is this the Talbot, so much feared abroad
That with his name the mothers still their babes?
