you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.

WESTMORELAND, [returning the toast]
I pledge your Grace, and if you knew what pains
I have bestowed to breed this present peace,
You would drink freely. But my love to you
Shall show itself more openly hereafter.

ARCHBISHOP
I do not doubt you.

WESTMORELAND  I am glad of it.--
Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.

MOWBRAY
You wish me health in very happy season,
For I am on the sudden something ill.

ARCHBISHOP
