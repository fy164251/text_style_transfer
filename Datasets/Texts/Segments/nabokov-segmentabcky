Dear Mrs. Torres,

My husband asks me to reply to your letter of May 14th. You ask in it in which of the two possible places in the stacks—American or Russian Literature—he would like to be if he had to choose one. His answer is that he would prefer to be in the American Literature since his best work was done in English.





Sincerely yours,

(Mrs. Vladimir N
