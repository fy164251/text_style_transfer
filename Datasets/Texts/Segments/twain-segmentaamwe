ù (Washoe is a pet nickname for Nevada) is a peculiar
Scriptural wind, in that no man knoweth ‚Äúwhence it cometh.‚Äù  That is to
say, where it originates.  It comes right over the mountains from the
West, but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the
other side!  It probably is manufactured on the mountain-top for the
occasion, and starts from there.  It is a pretty regular wind, in the
summer time.  Its office hours are from two in the afternoon till two the
next morn
