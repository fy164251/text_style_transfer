ve your turn for Rosalind?

ORLANDO  I can live no longer by thinking.

ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I will weary you then no
longer with idle talking. Know of me then--for
now I speak to some purpose--that I know you are
a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that
you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge,
insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labor
for a greater esteem than may in some little measure
draw a belief from you to do yourself good, and
not to grace me. Bel
