ays she to thee?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE  Marry, sir, such claim as you
would lay to your horse, and she would have me as
a beast; not that I being a beast she would have me,
but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays
claim to me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE  What is she?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE  A very reverend body, ay, such a
one as a man may not speak of without he say
"sir-reverence." I have but lean luck in the match,
and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.
