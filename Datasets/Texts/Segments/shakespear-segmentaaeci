MENENIUS
I would they were in Tiber. What the vengeance,
Could he not speak 'em fair?

[Enter Brutus and Sicinius with the rabble again.]


SICINIUS  Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?

SICINIUS
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands. He hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power
