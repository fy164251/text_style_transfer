soldiers of their pay
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
So help me God as I have watched the night--
Ay, night by night--in studying good for England!
That doit that e'er I wrested from the King,
Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
Be brought against me at my trial day!
No, many a pound of mine own proper store,
Because I would not tax the needy Commons,
Have I dispursed to the garrisons
And never asked for restitution.

CARDINAL
It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
