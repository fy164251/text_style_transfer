s anything that I consider to be of inferior quality. In fact, the piece1 I sent you is better than those I have published in the New Yorker so far. Your letter is so silly and rude that I do not think I want to have anything to do with you or the Atlantic any more. I am sending you a cheque for $800 and shall send the rest as soon as I am able to.

Yours faithfully,
