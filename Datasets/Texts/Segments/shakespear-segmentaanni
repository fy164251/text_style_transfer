JAILER
This morning.

WOOER  Was she well? Was she in health?
Sir, when did she sleep?

FIRST FRIEND, [aside]  These are strange questions.

JAILER
I do not think she was very well--for now
You make me mind her; but this very day
I asked her questions, and she answered me
So far from what she was, so childishly,
So sillily, as if she were a fool,
An innocent, and I was very angry.
But what of her, sir?

WOOER  Nothing but my pity;
But you must know it, and as good by me
