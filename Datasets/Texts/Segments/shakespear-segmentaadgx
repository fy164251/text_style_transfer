BENEDICK  I will swear by it that you love me, and I will
make him eat it that says I love not you.

BEATRICE  Will you not eat your word?

BENEDICK  With no sauce that can be devised to it. I
protest I love thee.

BEATRICE  Why then, God forgive me.

BENEDICK  What offense, sweet Beatrice?

BEATRICE  You have stayed me in a happy hour. I was

BENEDICK  And do it with all thy heart.

BEATRICE  I love you with so much
