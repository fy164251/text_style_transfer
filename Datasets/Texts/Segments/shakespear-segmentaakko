e have me killed?
Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
I never did her hurt in all my life.
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
To any living creature. Believe me, la,
I never killed a mouse, nor hurt a fly.
I trod upon a worm against my will,
But I wept for 't. How have I offended
Wherein my death might yield her any profit
Or my life imply her any danger?

LEONINE  My commission
Is not to reason of the deed, but do 't.

MARINA
You will not do 't for all the world, I hope.
