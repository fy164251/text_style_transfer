They had parted so much honesty among 'em--
At least good manners--as not thus to suffer
A man of his place, and so near our favor,
To dance attendance on their Lordships' pleasures,
And at the door, too, like a post with packets.

Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close.
We shall hear more anon.	[They draw the curtain.]
