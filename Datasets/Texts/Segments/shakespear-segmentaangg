ear and respect me.

SECOND QUEEN, [to Hippolyta]  For your mother's sake,
And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair
ones,
Hear and respect me.

THIRD QUEEN, [to Emilia]
Now for the love of him whom Jove hath marked
The honor of your bed, and for the sake
Of clear virginity, be advocate
For us and our distresses. This good deed
Shall raze you out o' th' book of trespasses
All you are set down there.

THESEUS, [to First Queen]
Sad lady, rise.

HIPPOLYTA, [to Second Queen]
