Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both.

[Enter a Gentleman.]

How now, sir?

GENTLEMAN  From the noble duke, your brother,
Madam, I bring you news: the knights are come.

EMILIA
To end the quarrel?

GENTLEMAN  Yes.

EMILIA  Would I might end first!
What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,
That my unspotted youth must now be soiled
With blood of princes, and my chastity
Be made the altar where the lives of lovers--
Two greater and two better never yet
Made mothers joy
