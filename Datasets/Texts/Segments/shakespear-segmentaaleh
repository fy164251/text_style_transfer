INCE  A beggar, brother?

YORK
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.

RICHARD
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.

YORK
A greater gift? O, that's the sword to it.

RICHARD
Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.

YORK
O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.

RICHARD
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.

YORK
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

RICHARD
