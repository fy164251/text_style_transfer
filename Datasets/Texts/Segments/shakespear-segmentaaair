ORCESTER
Good cousin, be advised. Stir not tonight.

VERNON, [to Hotspur]
Do not, my lord.

DOUGLAS  You do not counsel well.
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.

VERNON
Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life
(And I dare well maintain it with my life),
If well-respected honor bid me on,
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.
Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
Which of us fears.

DOUGLAS  Yea, or tonight.

VERNON  Conte
