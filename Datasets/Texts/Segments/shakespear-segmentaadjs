
MESSENGER  News, my good lord, from Rome.

ANTONY  Grates me, the sum.

CLEOPATRA  Nay, hear them, Antony.
Fulvia perchance is angry. Or who knows
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His powerful mandate to you: "Do this, or this;
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that.
Perform 't, or else we damn thee."

ANTONY  How, my love?

CLEOPATRA  Perchance? Nay, and most like.
You must not stay here longer; your dismission
Is come from Caesar. Therefore hear it, Antony.
Wher
