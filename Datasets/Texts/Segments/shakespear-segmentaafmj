night, your garments, your lowliness. And what
your Highness suffered under that shape, I beseech
you take it for your own fault and not mine, for, had
you been as I took you for, I made no offense.
Therefore, I beseech your Highness pardon me.

KING HENRY
Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns
And give it to this fellow.--Keep it, fellow,
And wear it for an honor in thy cap
Till I do challenge it.--Give him the crowns.--
And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.
