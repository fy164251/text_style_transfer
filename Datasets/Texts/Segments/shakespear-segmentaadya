TENANT  Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS  Hence, and shut your gates upon 's.
[(To the Scout.)] Our guider, come. To th' Roman
camp conduct us.
[They exit, the Lieutenant one way, Lartius another.]

Scene 8
=======
[Alarum, as in battle.
Enter Martius and Aufidius at several doors.]


MARTIUS
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS  We hate alike.
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
