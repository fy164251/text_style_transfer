one of his scenes with Charlotte. Therefore I have had Dr. Ray take over again (p. 20 a) after Humbert has finished with Annabel. It seems to me that it is very trim this way but if you still object to Ray's handling the Valeria scenes, we can have another discussion and try to find another way.

We shall leave on Monday, 27th, and return soon after 5th of July. The address will be: Glacier Lodge, Big Pine, Calif.; there is no phone at the lodge but messages can be left at Big Pine 351.
