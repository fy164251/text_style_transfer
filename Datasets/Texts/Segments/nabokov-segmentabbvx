turally it does hang together rather neatly. You will note the seeds I have planted and followed up (the dog, the gun, etc.). You will also note that some scenes are sketched in greater detail than others, and that I still have to write in many things relating to action, gestures, scenery, etc.

Do please ring me up as soon as you have a chance to read this.





Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
