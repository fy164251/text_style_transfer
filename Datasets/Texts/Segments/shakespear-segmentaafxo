No great offense belongs to 't, give your friend
Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk,
As they say spirits do, at midnight have
In them a wilder nature than the business
That seeks dispatch by day.

LOVELL  My lord, I love you,
And durst commend a secret to your ear
Much weightier than this work. The Queen's in
labor--
They say in great extremity--and feared
She'll with the labor end.

GARDINER  The fruit she goes with
I pray for heartily, that it may find
Good time
