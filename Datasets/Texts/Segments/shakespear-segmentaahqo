a married ear.

	When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,
	   And merry larks are plowmen's clocks;
	When turtles tread, and rooks and daws,
	   And maidens bleach their summer smocks;
	The cuckoo then on every tree
	Mocks married men, for thus sings he:
		"Cuckoo!
	Cuckoo, cuckoo!" O word of fear,
	Unpleasing to a married ear.


WINTER
	When icicles hang by the wall,
	   And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
	And Tom bears logs into the hall,
	   And milk comes frozen home in pail;
