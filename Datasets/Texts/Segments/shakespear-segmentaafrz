at pitch he please.

SUFFOLK  For me, my lords,
I love him not nor fear him; there's my creed.
As I am made without him, so I'll stand,
If the King please. His curses and his blessings
Touch me alike: they're breath I not believe in.
I knew him and I know him; so I leave him
To him that made him proud, the Pope.

NORFOLK  Let's in,
And with some other business put the King
From these sad thoughts that work too much upon
him.--
My lord, you'll bear us company?

CHAMBERLAIN  Excuse
