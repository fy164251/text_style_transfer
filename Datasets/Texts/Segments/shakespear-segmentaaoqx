of Naples? O, rejoice
Beyond a common joy, and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom
In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own.

ALONSO, [to Ferdinand and Miranda]  Give me your
hands.
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy!

GONZALO  Be it so. Amen.
