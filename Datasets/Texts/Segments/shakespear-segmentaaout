this, sir, is proclaimed through all our host:
That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
Tomorrow morning call some knight to arms
That hath a stomach, and such a one that dare
Maintain--I know not what; 'tis trash. Farewell.

AJAX  Farewell. Who shall answer him?

ACHILLES
I know not. 'Tis put to lott'ry. Otherwise,
He knew his man.	[Achilles and Patroclus exit.]

AJAX  O, meaning you? I will go learn more of it.
[He exits.]
