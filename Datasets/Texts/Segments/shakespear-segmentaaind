To make a false one.

ISABELLA
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in Earth.

ANGELO
Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly:
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now took your brother's life, or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stained?

ISABELLA  Sir, believe this:
I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO
I talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA  How say you?
