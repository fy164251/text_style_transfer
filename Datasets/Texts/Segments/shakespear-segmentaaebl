lot,
To curb the will of the nobility.
Suffer 't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS  Call 't not a plot.
The people cry you mocked them; and, of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined,
Scandaled the suppliants for the people, called them
Timepleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS
Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS  Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS
Have you informed them sithence?

BRUTUS  How? I inform
them?
