Brother of England, how may we content
This widow lady? In her right we came,
Which we, God knows, have turned another way
To our own vantage.

KING JOHN  We will heal up all,
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Brittany
And Earl of Richmond, and this rich, fair town
We make him lord of.--Call the Lady Constance.
Some speedy messenger bid her repair
To our solemnity. [Salisbury exits.] I trust we
shall,
If not fill up the measure of her will,
Yet in some measure satisfy her so
