e your Lordship. I'll leave you.

BERTRAM
Now will I lead you to the house and show you
The lass I spoke of.

SECOND LORD  But you say she's honest.

BERTRAM
That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once
And found her wondrous cold. But I sent to her,
By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,
Tokens and letters, which she did re-send.
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature.
Will you go see her?

SECOND LORD  With all my heart, my lord.
