ame imminent. I would like nevertheless to mention that while I consider the royalty you offer as very generous, I would want a rather more substantial advance than the one you offered to Mr. G. I prefer to say this now since I would not want you to undertake any steps in behalf of LOLITA under the impression that we were agreed on this point.

With best wishes,





Sincerely yours,

Vladimir Nabokov
