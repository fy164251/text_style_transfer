November 9, 1956

Dear Mr. Nemerov,

A correspondent has sent me a clippingâ€”your delightful letter in a recent issue of the N.Y. Times. I think it is a very friendly and gallant gesture on your part. I wish I could send you a copy of "Lolita" but I too find it difficult to obtain copies. I have never been officially notified, however, that the book has been actually banned. You would do me a great favor if you could give me additional details.





Cordially yours,





TO: JASON EPSTEIN
