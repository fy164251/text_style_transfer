 if I had written it down beforehand. But that does not matter much nowâ€”you have plenty of material without the deleted pages.2

I am enclosing a copy of the bibliography.

I am terribly sorry if my extensive cuts are causing you any disappointment, but I am sure you will understand that after all I am almost exclusively a writer, and my style is all I have.

With best regards from my wife and me.





Sincerely,

Vladimir Nabokov
