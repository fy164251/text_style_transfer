ved your Worship truly, sir, this eight
years; an I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear
out a knave against an honest man, I have but a
very little credit with your Worship. The knave is
mine honest friend, sir; therefore I beseech you let
him be countenanced.

SHALLOW  Go to, I say, he shall have no wrong. Look
about, Davy. [Davy exits.] Where are you, Sir John?
Come, come, come, off with your boots.--Give me
your hand, Master Bardolph.

BARDOLPH  I am glad to see your Worship.
