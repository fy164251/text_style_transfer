BERTRAM
Undone, and forfeited to cares forever!

PAROLLES  What's the matter, sweetheart?

BERTRAM
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
I will not bed her.

PAROLLES  What, what, sweetheart?

BERTRAM
O my Parolles, they have married me!
I'll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her.

PAROLLES  France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
the tread of a man's foot.
