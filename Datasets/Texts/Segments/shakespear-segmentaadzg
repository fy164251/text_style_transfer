CORIOLANUS  O,
You have, I know, petitioned all the gods
For my prosperity.	[Kneels.]

VOLUMNIA  Nay, my good soldier, up.
[He stands.]
My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honor newly named--
What is it? Coriolanus must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife--

CORIOLANUS  My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined
home,
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear
And mothers that lack sons.
