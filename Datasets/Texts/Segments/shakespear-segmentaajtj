ise, I say!

BRABANTIO  What, have you lost your wits?

RODERIGO
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

BRABANTIO  Not I. What are you?

RODERIGO
My name is Roderigo.

BRABANTIO  The worser welcome.
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee. And now in madness,
Being full of supper and distemp'ring draughts,
Upon malicious bravery dost thou come
To start my quiet.

RODERIGO  Sir, sir, sir--
