
SECOND GENTLEMAN  'Tis well. The citizens
I am sure have shown at full their royal minds,
As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward
In celebration of this day with shows,
Pageants, and sights of honor.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  Never greater,
Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
May I be bold to ask what that contains,
That paper in your hand?

FIRST GENTLEMAN  Yes, 'tis the list
Of those that claim their offices this day
By custom of the coronation.
