NIDES
Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
A married life. Her reason to herself is only known,
Which from her by no means can I get.

SECOND KNIGHT
May we not get access to her, my lord?

SIMONIDES
Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied her
To her chamber that 'tis impossible.
One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery.
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowed,
And on her virgin honor will not break it.
