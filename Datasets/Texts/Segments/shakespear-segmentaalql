ROMEO  I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older
when you have found him than he was when you
sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for
fault of a worse.

NURSE  You say well.

MERCUTIO  Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i'
faith, wisely, wisely.

NURSE  If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
you.

BENVOLIO  She will indite him to some supper.

MERCUTIO  A bawd, a bawd, a bawd. So ho!

ROMEO  What hast thou found?

MERCUTIO
