umbler after it is done
Than when it was a-doing.

SICINIUS  Bid them home.
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Stand in their ancient strength.

BRUTUS  Dismiss them home.
[Aedile exits.]
Here comes his mother.

[Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Menenius.]


SICINIUS  Let's not meet her.

BRUTUS  Why?

SICINIUS  They say she's mad.

BRUTUS
They have ta'en note of us. Keep on your way.

VOLUMNIA
O, you're well met. The hoarded plague o' th' gods
Requite your love!
