An honorable murderer, if you will,
For naught I did in hate, but all in honor.

This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

OTHELLO  Ay.

CASSIO
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

OTHELLO
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

IAGO
Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.
From this time forth I never will speak word.
