EMILIA  I know a lady in Venice would have walked
barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

DESDEMONA, [singing]
	The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
	   Sing all a green willow.
	Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
	   Sing willow, willow, willow.
	The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her
moans,
	   Sing willow, willow, willow;
	Her salt tears fell from her, and softened the
stones--
Lay by these.
	   Sing willow, willow, willow.
