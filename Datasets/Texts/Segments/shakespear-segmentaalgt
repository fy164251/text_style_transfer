bigamy.
By her in his unlawful bed he got
This Edward, whom our manners call "the Prince."
More bitterly could I expostulate,
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
This proffered benefit of dignity,
If not to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times
Unto a lineal, true-derived course.

MAYOR
Do, good my lord. Your citizens entreat you.
