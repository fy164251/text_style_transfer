Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy
head?

ROBIN, [in Lysander's voice]
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come, recreant! Come, thou
child!
I'll whip thee with a rod. He is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.

DEMETRIUS  Yea, art thou there?

ROBIN, [in Lysander's voice]
Follow my voice. We'll try no manhood here.
