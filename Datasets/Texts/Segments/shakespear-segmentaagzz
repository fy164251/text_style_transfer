tizens of Angiers, ope your gates.
Let in that amity which you have made,
For at Saint Mary's Chapel presently
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.--
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
I know she is not, for this match made up
Her presence would have interrupted much.
Where is she and her son? Tell me, who knows.

DAUPHIN
She is sad and passionate at your Highness' tent.

KING PHILIP
And by my faith, this league that we have made
Will give her sadness very little cure.-
