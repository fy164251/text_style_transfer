LYSANDER
"Amen, amen" to that fair prayer, say I,
And then end life when I end loyalty!
Here is my bed. Sleep give thee all his rest!

HERMIA
With half that wish the wisher's eyes be pressed!
[They sleep.]

ROBIN
	Through the forest have I gone,
	But Athenian found I none
	On whose eyes I might approve
	This flower's force in stirring love.
[He sees Lysander.]
	Night and silence! Who is here?
	Weeds of Athens he doth wear.
	This is he my master said
