You are probably aware of this already. So very fond of you as Miss <MASK> is, it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine.

I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. <MASK> were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy.

Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. <MASK> visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in",Austen

1153,2798," better than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate--his feelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who wanted more. Mrs. <MASK>",Austen

Young, pretty, and gentle, however, she had no awkwardnesses that were not as good as graces, and there were few persons present that were not disposed to praise her. She was attractive, she was modest, she was Sir Thomas's niece, and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford. It was enough to give her general favour. Sir <MASK> himself was watching her progress down the dance with much complacency; he was proud of his niece; and without attributing all her personal beauty, as Mrs. <MASK> seemed to do, to her transplantation to Mansfield,",Austen
1159,1202," of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was all good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. <MASK> offered to contrive his dress, Mr. <MASK> assured him that Anhalt's last scene with the <MASK> admitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. <MASK> undertook to count his speeches. “Perhaps,” said Tom, “Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now. Perhaps you may persuade _her_.” “No, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act.” “Oh! very well.” And not another word was said; but <MASK> felt",Austen
1160,2260," to hear and believe just what Mrs. <MASK> chose to tell her; and looked no farther. Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and but for her acquaintance with the <MASK> of Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the <MASK> occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place. <MASK> encouraged her talkativeness--amused by such a picture of",Austen

With undoubting decision she directly began her adieus; and <MASK> began at the same time to recollect that his mother had been inquiring for her, and that he had walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back. Fanny's hurry increased; and without in the least expecting Edmund's attendance, she would have hastened away alone; but the general pace was quickened, and they all accompanied her into the house, through which it was necessary to pass. Dr. <MASK> was in the vestibule, and as they stopt to speak to him she found, from",Austen

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. <MASK> was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, <MASK>",Austen

As they passed through the hall, Lady <MASK> opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.

I trust, at least, that you do not think Mr. <MASK> looking ill,” turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.",Austen

But by an appeal to her affection for her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she consented to this increase of establishment, <MASK> was shortly subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell <MASK> when she saw him next, that it must be declined. She was faithful to her word;",Austen

We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.” “I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother. “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.” “I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not particularly like your",Austen

Why the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was still something remarkable, for she could now manage them with perfect ease.

She got away as soon as she could",Austen

Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation, both of pain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William's advancement, whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more. She had no doubt that her note must appear excessively ill-written, that the language would disgrace a child, for her distress had allowed no",Austen

A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and both placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a little lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was enough to catch any man's heart. The season, the scene, the air, were all favourable to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. <MASK> and her tambour frame were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as everything will turn to",Austen

I hope he will not mind it so very much.” “Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed,” cried Emma. “At this moment, perhaps, Mr. <MASK> is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.” “My picture!--But he",Austen

He had learned his part--all his parts, for he took every trifling one that could be united with the Butler, and began to be impatient to be acting; and every day thus",Austen

He looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about “honour,”--glanced at <MASK> and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off an awkward moment, <MASK> smilingly said, “You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry.” “I have no hesitation in saying,” replied",Austen

Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced. Miss <MASK> had a delicate",Austen
1179,443," that her apartment was very unlike the one which <MASK> had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of. It was by no means unreasonably large, and contained neither tapestry nor velvet. The walls were papered, the floor was carpeted; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those of the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not of the latest fashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful. Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point, she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything, as she",Austen

She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on, “It might be distressing, for the moment,” said she; “but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about it.” Harriet said, “very true,” and she “would not think about it;” but still she talked of it--still she could talk",Austen

You are trying not to smile.” “I am afraid,” said he, composing his features, “I am very much afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.” “Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.” “There is one subject,” he replied, “I hope but one, on which we do not think alike.” He paused a moment, again smiling, with his",Austen

It would be dreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!” “There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you exactly. A crowd in a little",Austen

But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! they were infinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of! It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced. He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with",Austen

Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!” “Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment. “Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can",Austen

The result of his reverie was, “No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure you.” And soon afterwards, “Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman--but not even <MASK> <MASK> is perfect.

I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.

1188,827," met with; and having once made up his mind, the whole business was soon completed. The new mare proved a treasure; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose, and <MASK> was then put in almost full possession of her. She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old grey pony; but her delight in Edmund's mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, was beyond all her words to express. She regarded her cousin as an example",Austen
1189,3151," talked of rain.--“I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,” said <MASK> to his father: “Miss <MASK> must not be forgotten:” and away he went. Mr. <MASK> was following; but Mrs. <MASK> detained him, to gratify him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing. “A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a",Austen

Mr. Crawford, I think you call for him at half-past nine?” Fanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her eyes for denial; and it ended in a gracious “Well, well!” which was permission. “Yes, half-past nine,” said <MASK> to <MASK> as the latter was leaving them, “and I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind sister to get up for _me_.” And in a lower tone to Fanny, “I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to-morrow.” After a short",Austen
1191,3195," neighbourhood to Mr. <MASK> he set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself. Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So <MASK> thought, at least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting",Austen
1192,2971," manner. She heard him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh. He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said, “It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield. My regard for <MASK> is most warm”-- He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was more in love with her than <MASK> had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. <MASK> soon followed; and the necessity",Austen

Much was said, and much was ate, and all went well. The particular object of the day was then considered. How would Mr. <MASK> like, in what manner would he chuse, to take a survey of the grounds? Mr. <MASK> mentioned his curricle. Mr. <MASK> suggested the greater desirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two. “To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments, might be an evil even beyond the loss",Austen

She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great staircase, till she had satisfied herself of Mr. <MASK> having left the house; but when convinced of his being gone, she was eager to go down and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own, and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to what would now be William's destination. Sir <MASK> was as joyful as she could desire, and very kind and communicative; and she had so comfortable a talk",Austen

CHAPTER IX Mr. <MASK> was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the whole party were welcomed by him with due attention. In the drawing-room they were met with equal cordiality by the mother, and Miss <MASK> had all the distinction with each that she could wish. After the business of arriving was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were thrown open",Austen

Oh, Lydia!” “I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would not marry <MASK> if he had not a real regard for her.

Mr. <MASK> was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. “So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should",Austen

Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing <MASK> <MASK> shall certainly have her very often at my",Austen

You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you prefer Mr. <MASK> to every other person; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this moment",Austen
1253,2382," to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words. “Robert <MASK> has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I hope it will not be long before he does. Your views for <MASK> are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if <MASK> is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.” <MASK> laughed and disclaimed. He continued, “Depend upon it, Elton will not do.",Austen
1254,2775," reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour or two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired <MASK> sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than <MASK> could have supposed. Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He begged to be shewn the house",Austen
1255,1486," am sorry to say that I am unable to answer your question. I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may have an opportunity of doing ere long.” “I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. <MASK> said <MASK> <MASK> leaning forward, “and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction. But I believe” (seeing Fanny looked distressed) “it must be at some other time. There is _one_ person in company",Austen
1256,4876," not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir <MASK> and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.” This letter gave <MASK> some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that <MASK> would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she",Austen

CHAPTER 28 Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make <MASK> regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for <MASK> neither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time to attend <MASK> <MASK> to a party, from which Mrs. <MASK> was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her",Austen

She cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister. With the Musgroves, there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest, which the same consciousness",Austen

'Tis true, we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour, for our mode of living, as you see, is plain and unpretending; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable.” Northanger Abbey! These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine's feelings to the highest point of ecstasy. Her",Austen
1261,263," looked happy again. “A most heavenly thought indeed! Now, my sweet Catherine, all our distresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have a most delightful party.” “This will not do,” said Catherine; “I cannot submit to this. I must run after Miss <MASK> directly and set her right.” Isabella, however, caught hold of one hand, <MASK> of the other, and remonstrances poured in from all three. Even <MASK> was quite angry. When everything was settled, when Miss <MASK> herself said that Tuesday would suit her as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make any further",Austen
1262,875," In comparison with his brother, <MASK> would have nothing to say. The soup would be sent round in a most spiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling, and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any former haunch, or a single entertaining story, about “my friend such a one.” She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper end of the table, and in observing Mr. <MASK> who was now making his appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords' arrival. He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and",Austen

You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain. One cannot fix one's eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy.” “To say the truth,” replied Miss Crawford, “I am something like the famous Doge at the court of <MASK> XIV.; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had told me a year ago that this place",Austen
1264,2921," honoured!” She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment. “How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.” So began Miss Bates; and Mr. <MASK> seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and",Austen
1265,765," her pain, but he now felt that she required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured, in the first place, to lessen her fears of them all, and gave her especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with <MASK> and Julia, and being as merry as possible. From this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She felt that she had a friend, and the kindness of her cousin <MASK> gave her better spirits with everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people less formidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease to fear, she began at least to know their",Austen
1266,2365," Mr. <MASK> is a very respectable young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over.” “Not Harriet's equal!” exclaimed Mr. <MASK> loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “No, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or",Austen
1267,2114," for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, with a family whom she had just grown intimate with: a family of lively, agreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for to _their_ house Mr. <MASK> had constant access at all times. His having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew. Mr. <MASK> had been gone at this time to Bath, to pass a few days with his mother, and bring her back to town, and <MASK> was with these friends without any restraint, without even Julia; for <MASK> had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before, on a visit to some",Austen
1268,6592," till her sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it. But the resolution was made only to be broken. <MASK> had been two or three days at home, before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in the lane before the house. The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of <MASK> in an exercise hitherto untried since",Austen
1269,5440," for the evening must depend. “If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for ever.” The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss <MASK> was making tea, and <MASK> pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper: “The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of",Austen

We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady <MASK> <MASK> <MASK> does not look on the match with a friendly eye.' “_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?

Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor, and such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless, guileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions, and knowing no disguise.” “Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,” said <MASK> with a smile. “But perhaps,” observed Catherine, “though she has behaved so ill by our family, she may behave better by yours. Now she has really got the man she likes, she may be constant.” “Indeed I am afraid",Austen

He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. <MASK> knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched",Austen
1273,4939," Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. <MASK> looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. <MASK> merely curtseyed to him without saying a word. Colonel <MASK> entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation",Austen
1274,5431," every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. <MASK> was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent. When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. <MASK> was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time. “You are quite a visit in my debt,",Austen
1275,4590," Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much",Austen
1276,3047," her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. <MASK> ventured this apology for Jane. “We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for what she goes to.” “You are right, Mrs. <MASK> said Mr. <MASK> warmly, “Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. <MASK>",Austen
1277,2036," entirely without any; she must have something to write about, even to her niece; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant's gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant's morning calls, it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to. There was a rich amends, however, preparing for her. Lady Bertram's hour of good luck came. Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund's letter, Fanny had one from her aunt, beginning thus-- “My Dear Fanny,--I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming intelligence, which I make no doubt will give you",Austen
1278,4012," herself so spoken of. The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then appeared. ""You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;"" cried he, turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which seemed almost restoring the past. She coloured deeply, and he recollected himself and moved away. She expressed herself most willing, ready, happy to remain. ""It was what she had been thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do. A bed on the floor in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if <MASK> <MASK> would but think so."" One thing more, and all",Austen

""Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,"" said Elinor. ""She knows her own worth too well for false shame,"" replied Edward. ""Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should",Austen
1280,6465," she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles. She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house, on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter",Austen

It was a fine arrangement for <MASK> <MASK> who was close to Fanny, and with his hands full of business, having two persons' cards to manage as well as his own; for though it was impossible for <MASK> not to feel herself mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to inspirit her play, sharpen her",Austen

There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many",Austen

Yes, indeed, there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful",Austen

Her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed; and her mother, perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect, proposed, as another expedient for restoring her spirits, that they should call on Mrs. Allen. The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart; and, as they walked, Mrs. <MASK> quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James's disappointment. “We are sorry for him,” said she; “but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going",Austen

He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing. He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in him",Austen

It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;” (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--” She stopped to breathe. <MASK> thought first of herself, and then of Harriet. “More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an engagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any body say, when",Austen
1287,5270," I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that <MASK> should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.” “When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to",Austen

Chapter 40 Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint <MASK> with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her",Austen

But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of children, feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or <MASK> pass by with a flower in her hat. In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. <MASK> took care not to be divided from the female branch; and after chapel he still continued",Austen

Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with <MASK> he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister. Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him. This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him",Austen
1292,1313," his sight that might have distressed him. The curtain, over which she had presided with such talent and such success, went off with her to her cottage, where she happened to be particularly in want of green baize. CHAPTER XXI Sir Thomas's return made a striking change in the ways of the family, independent of Lovers' Vows. Under his government, <MASK> was an altered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits of many others saddened--it was all sameness and gloom compared with the past--a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was little intercourse with",Austen

She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief points on which <MASK> grounded his apology; did justice to his repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard. <MASK> said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one. She caught every",Austen

Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness had perfectly answered. Mr. <MASK> had been exceedingly well amused. Mrs. <MASK> had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this",Austen

A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected. A large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene. One five minutes brought a note, the next a parcel; and <MASK> had not been there half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half filled: a party of steady old friends were seated",Austen

Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears.” His sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning, were quite as impatient of his advice, quite as",Austen

She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence. ""At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,"" added Mrs. Dashwood, ""even if I",Austen

It's the best berth at Spithead. But here is my sister, sir; here is Fanny,” turning and leading her forward; “it is so dark you do not see her.” With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her, Mr. Price now received his daughter; and having given her a cordial hug, and observed that she was grown into a woman, and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon, seemed",Austen

Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.” “Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.” “And here is Mrs. <MASK> and Mr. <MASK> <MASK> too!--Quite delightful; so many friends!” “No, not now, I thank you.

There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!

Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain <MASK> was again in sight. She saw him not far off. He saw her too; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her. She felt that something must",Austen
1302,4968," whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. She had once or twice suggested to <MASK> the possibility of his being partial to her, but <MASK> always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. <MASK> did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in",Austen
1303,5193," and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister. Chapter 44 <MASK> had settled it that Mr. <MASK> would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.

But <MASK> did not give into it very graciously, whether from not considering Captain <MASK> entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe <MASK> a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed. Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard. She boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries.

Fanny saw that she was approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still better. From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made still happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who was holding open the door, said, as she passed him, “You must dance with me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like, except the first.” She had",Austen

Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure <MASK> will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.” But as",Austen

If he knew them better, he would value their society as it deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves: my sisters seem out of spirits, and <MASK> is certainly not at his ease. Dr. and Mrs. <MASK> would enliven us, and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father.” “Do you think so?” said Fanny: “in my opinion, my uncle would not like",Austen
1324,243," a pleasant walk; I never thought of such a thing; but I begged Mr. <MASK> so earnestly to stop; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not--Oh! You were not there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. <MASK> would only have stopped, I would have jumped out and run after you.” Is there a <MASK> in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration? <MASK> <MASK> at least was not. With a yet sweeter smile, he said everything that need be said of his sister's concern, regret, and dependence on Catherine's honour. “Oh! Do not say Miss <MASK> was not angry,” cried",Austen

If not wise or refined herself, she would have connected him with those who were;",Austen

Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!” Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;",Austen

She dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on <MASK> might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a moment wished <MASK> a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more",Austen

With something of consciousness he shook his head at his sister, and laughingly replied, “I cannot say there was much done at Sotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after each other, and bewildered.” As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter, he added, in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, “I should be sorry to have my",Austen

On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Sir <MASK> at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.

He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.

Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it. It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it",Austen

How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along, and my looking in and seeing",Austen

This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. <MASK> I declare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. <MASK> for",Austen
1360,6499," reflections. About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;--she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--and",Austen
1361,4697," tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. But <MASK> was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen",Austen

""And you really are not engaged to him!"" said she. ""Yet it certainly soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I shall not lose you so soon, and <MASK> will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he should",Austen

My mother's are really very good indeed. <MASK> often says, when she is here, 'I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well.'” All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss <MASK> to stop for breath; and <MASK> said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax's handwriting. “You are extremely kind,” replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; “you who are",Austen

It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.

After the hints you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last time I was in company with him, I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on. I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this. Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of",Austen
1367,3273," her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.--Still Mrs. <MASK> insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow's post.--How <MASK> could bear it at all, was astonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--“Should not they walk? Would not Mr. <MASK>",Austen

The remembrance of all her earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered in being torn from them, came over her with renewed strength, and it seemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since grown out of the separation. To be in the centre of such a circle, loved by so many, and more loved by all than she had ever been before; to feel affection without fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal of",Austen
1369,4557," They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.” “Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing at all.” “Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.” “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are",Austen
1370,1568," when it was given--and for _her_ to be opening the ball--and with Mr. <MASK> too! She hoped they would not envy her that distinction _now_; but when she looked back to the state of things in the autumn, to what they had all been to each other when once dancing in that house before, the present arrangement was almost more than she could understand herself. The ball began. It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny, for the first dance at least: her partner was in excellent spirits, and tried to impart them to her; but she was a great deal too much frightened to have any enjoyment till",Austen
1371,1739," _once_, I told Sir <MASK> I must _once_, and then I shall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece.” And looking at her complacently, she added, “Humph, we certainly are a handsome family!” Fanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say; when, hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side, she presently answered-- “My dear aunt, _you_ cannot wish me to do differently from what I have done, I am sure. _You_ cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me, should not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that.” “No, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when such an",Austen

""But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair."" ""Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS."" ""But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for I saw him cut it off.

1373,6260," of these disqualifications for being agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want of elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper. When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land, and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William, who were nearly of the same age. Had both",Austen
1374,1180," talked and laughed, till within the last three years, when she had quitted them. The room had then become useless, and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny, when she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books, which she was still glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above: but gradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased, she had added to her possessions, and spent more of her time there; and having nothing to oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it was now generally",Austen
1375,2926," really are so shocked! Mrs. <MASK> may well be angry. <MASK> <MASK> mentioned it here. You should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. <MASK> cannot stop. He is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....” “Yes,” said Jane, “we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.” “Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was open, and the",Austen
1376,5654," her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland. The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as <MASK> <MASK> was entirely unknown to Mrs.",Austen
1377,5184," answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. <MASK> name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged. “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?” The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to",Austen
1378,747," point of great delicacy, and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct.” Mrs. <MASK> was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreed with him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hope that between them it would be easily managed. It will be readily believed that Mrs. <MASK> did not write to her sister in vain. Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be fixed on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer most thankfully, assuring them of her daughter's being a very well-disposed, good-humoured",Austen
1379,1489," arrangement, previously communicated to his wife and sister; but _that_ seemed forgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she settled it all herself. Fanny's last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl which <MASK> was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford's quicker hand, and she was obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention. CHAPTER XXVI William's desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary impression on his uncle. The hope of an opportunity, which Sir <MASK> had then given, was not",Austen
1380,4547," when Mr. <MASK> called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, <MASK> soon afterwards left the room. “Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.” “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, “there is a meanness in _all_ the arts",Austen
1381,5471," of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady <MASK> de Bourgh. They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. <MASK> and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what <MASK> felt. She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. <MASK> had",Austen
1382,2217," supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss <MASK> if Mr. <MASK> were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_",Austen
1383,4885," presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information. It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, <MASK> was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the",Austen
1384,4867," soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. <MASK> could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like <MASK> <MASK> and how happy she would dare pronounce",Austen
1385,4988," with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. <MASK> noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to <MASK> was to end on the day after the next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with <MASK> again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all",Austen
1386,3657," her to be the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself. Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--The intimacy between her and <MASK> must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner. Before the end of September, <MASK> attended <MASK> to church,",Austen
1387,4094," his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a sensible, discerning mind. As soon as he could, he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her. She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme. His regret increased as he listened. He had spent his whole solitary evening in",Austen
1388,5382," the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. “There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some",Austen
1389,2919," and much less compunction with respect to her.--This amiable, upright, perfect <MASK> <MASK> was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings. He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--Emma took the opportunity of whispering, “You speak too plain. She must understand you.” “I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning.” “But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.” “I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave",Austen
1390,3050," spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently. And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. <MASK> by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. <MASK> treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as <MASK> <MASK> probably never fell in Mrs.",Austen
1391,1104," ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. And as to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be",Austen
1392,13," befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad, invited her to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. <MASK> were all compliance, and <MASK> all happiness. CHAPTER 2 In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland's personal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks' residence in Bath, it may be stated, for the reader's more certain information, lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition",Austen
1393,6483," in any emergence. Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements. She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name. Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her situation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. <MASK> who attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss <MASK> was equally",Austen

1395,3990," as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had Captain <MASK> by her side. ""Miss Elliot,"" said he, speaking rather low, ""you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much. I wish he could have such company oftener. It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is; but what can we do? We cannot part."" ""No,"" said Anne, ""that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of",Austen

I could not tell whether you would be for some meat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would have got something ready. And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand. It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street.",Austen

I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.” “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. <MASK> himself?” “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.” “This",Austen

Mr <MASK> was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant. He was a married man, and",Austen
1399,6464," away through the winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen. In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious",Austen
1400,626," moving close to her door made her start; it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway--and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it. She trembled a little at the idea of anyone's approaching so cautiously; but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm, or misled by a raised imagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the door. Eleanor, and only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine's spirits, however, were tranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor's cheeks were pale, and her manner greatly agitated. Though",Austen
1401,5554," it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.” This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her. “My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a",Austen

She was ready to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. <MASK> was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. <MASK> had no penetration. She had been",Austen

But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are several.

How could it be otherwise, with such an education and adviser? Under the disadvantages, indeed, which both have had, is it not wonderful that they should be what they are? Crawford's _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto been too much his guides. Happily, those feelings have generally been good. You will supply the rest; and a most fortunate man he is to",Austen

I begged him to excuse me, and get some other partner--but no, not he; after aspiring to my hand, there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance, he wanted to be with me. Oh! Such nonsense! I told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches and compliments; and so--and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him, might take it",Austen

But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. “I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last",Austen

Sir <MASK> would not hear of it; and Mrs. Norris's anger against <MASK> was so much the greater, from considering _her_ residence there as the motive. She persisted in placing his scruples to _her_ account, though Sir <MASK> very solemnly assured her that, had there been no young woman in question, had there been no young person of either sex belonging to him, to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have offered so great an insult to the neighbourhood as",Austen
1409,4588," himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. <MASK> also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. When tea was over, Mr. <MASK>",Austen

I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny. I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate, I know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love of one of your oldest friends.” And so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but quickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out,",Austen
1411,122," him the smiling tribute of recognition. She returned it with pleasure, and then advancing still nearer, he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen, by whom he was very civilly acknowledged. “I am very happy to see you again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had left Bath.” He thanked her for her fears, and said that he had quitted it for a week, on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her. “Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it is just the place for young people--and indeed for everybody else too.

The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the steepest of them. With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. <MASK> was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her; and she had at this",Austen

She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain",Austen

She could not",Austen

She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered. Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss <MASK> still",Austen
1416,3311," who it came from. An abominable puppy!--You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer. Miss <MASK> must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill.

""You may certainly ask to be forgiven,"" said Elinor, ""because you have offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother's anger."" He agreed that he might. ""And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first."" He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier",Austen

She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!--I found he was",Austen

A little while ago, every letter to <MASK> brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls",Austen

With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence. She heard it at dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentioned with regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling--from the sincerity of Edmund's too partial regard, to the unconcern of his mother speaking entirely by rote. Mrs. <MASK> began to look about her, and wonder that his falling in love with <MASK> had come to nothing; and could almost",Austen

There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side--but no love. Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. <MASK> to urge his nephew's instant return. Mrs. <MASK> was unwell--far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when,Austen
1422,1034," more caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings brought them before her. They were just returned into the wilderness from the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very soon after their leaving her, and they had been across a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees. This was their history. It was evident that they had been spending their time pleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their absence. Fanny's best consolation was in",Austen

1424,2078," to regard a slight one. Very uncomfortable she was, and must continue, till she heard from Miss <MASK> again. It was impossible to banish the letter from her thoughts, and she could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any human being. Miss <MASK> need not have urged secrecy with so much warmth; she might have trusted to her sense of what was due to her cousin. The next day came and brought no second letter. Fanny was disappointed. She could still think of little else all the morning; but, when her father came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual, she was so far",Austen
1425,2994," “You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do for you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!” Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do, made <MASK> feel that she had never loved <MASK> so well, nor valued her affection so highly before. “There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards to herself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the",Austen

On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?” “You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,” said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour. “Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?” “His misfortunes!” repeated <MASK>",Austen

""To be sure,"" said she, ""it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. <MASK> should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in."" ""Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that purchase."" ""Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.

She was acknowledged to be quite right, and the two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the proper Frederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr. <MASK> who was always answered for by <MASK> as willing to do anything; when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to be scrupulous on Miss Crawford's account. “This",Austen
1429,4710," She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.” “I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.” “But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.” “I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other",Austen

He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence. But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. <MASK> she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet more",Austen

Could she have foreseen such a circumstance, nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others; and, as it was, she could only lament her ill luck,",Austen

The chain will agree with William's cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace.” “For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I am sure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather",Austen

They were stopping, however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when <MASK> caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. <MASK> informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument. “For my companion tells <MASK> said she, “that I",Austen
1434,6569," your composure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you as the object most desirable. And I believe <MASK> will be the most happy with him of the two."" <MASK> was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age, characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile. ""He opened his",Austen

I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my",Austen

Miss <MASK> saw much of Sir Thomas's thoughts as he stood, and having, in spite of all his wrongs towards her, a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him, took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of Fanny. Her praise was warm, and he received it as she could wish, joining in it as far as discretion, and politeness, and slowness of speech would allow, and certainly appearing to greater advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards, when",Austen

If I could but have kept longer away!” They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage pales, when a sudden",Austen

She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss <MASK> to be now actually determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. “It must be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel",Austen

She was not often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor did she desire it. Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the bearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the harvest, the cottages, the cattle, the children, she found entertainment that could only have been heightened by having <MASK> to speak to of what she felt. That was the",Austen

What! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right, by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say? No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.

His being only a bystander was not disclaimed. After continuing in chat with the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss <MASK> returned to the party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to interest herself in their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden recollection, she exclaimed, “My good friends, you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let me know",Austen
1442,5463," are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!” Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. <MASK> was beyond competition her",Austen

Surry is full of beauties.” “Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you know. Surry is the garden of England.” “Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as Surry.” “No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile. “I never heard any county but <MASK> called so.” <MASK>",Austen

It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she had ever received from him; she might never receive another; it was impossible that she ever should receive another so",Austen

She instantly begged her sister would entreat <MASK> <MASK> to take them home, as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer. Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed that <MASK> was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they departed as soon the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was",Austen
1446,1748," of Fanny's embarrassment to make him scrupulously guard against exciting it a second time, by any word, or look, or movement. <MASK> called the next day, and on the score of Edmund's return, Sir <MASK> felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it was really a necessary compliment. He staid of course, and <MASK> had then ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what degree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners; and it was so little, so very, very little--every chance, every possibility of it, resting upon her",Austen

The two dances were",Austen

He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to",Austen

Why he had done it, what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality, and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as <MASK> herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long; and, after a due course of useless conjecture, that “it was a strange business, and that he must be a very strange man,” grew enough for",Austen

They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. <MASK> does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered <MASK> at Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed into",Austen

THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I understand she is a woman of very good fortune.

She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any",Austen
1459,5185," She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss <MASK> might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her. They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. <MASK> was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. <MASK> were",Austen

His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss <MASK> perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches",Austen

I had not, Miss Crawford, been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn. I was quiet, but I was not blind.

He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered himself again, and after saying, ""Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the",Austen
1516,2508," in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it. CHAPTER XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. <MASK> <MASK> in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had nothing to wish",Austen
1517,5580," of the sisters was exactly what <MASK> had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. <MASK> had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take",Austen
1518,4480," opinion. In understanding, <MASK> was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but <MASK> was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. <MASK> was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, <MASK> was continually giving offense. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there",Austen
1519,2434," Elton, though hesitating a good deal while he spoke; “I have no hesitation in saying--at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life.” After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. <MASK> could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh. She ran away to indulge the",Austen
1520,4230," of the past. She could not contemplate the change as implying less. He must love her. These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him, without even trying to discern him. When their places were determined on, and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for a time to be",Austen
1521,744," be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.” “Should her disposition be really bad,” said Sir Thomas, “we must not, for our own children's sake, continue her in the family; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to wish altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; but these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous for her associates. Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, I should have considered the introduction of",Austen
1522,2359," think of but one thing--Who is in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?” <MASK> was more than half in hopes of Mr. <MASK> having dropt a hint. Mr. <MASK> was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr. <MASK> looked up to him. “I have reason to think,” he replied, “that <MASK> <MASK> will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert <MASK> is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.” “He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that",Austen
1523,440," to which she looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care, were yet less what her fancy had portrayed. To be sure, the pointed arch was preserved--the form of them was Gothic--they might be even casements--but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! To an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest stone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the difference was very distressing. The general, perceiving how her eye was employed, began to talk of the smallness",Austen
1524,1942," yielding temper would have shrunk from asserting. <MASK> tried to be useful, where _she_ could only have gone away and cried; and that <MASK> was useful she could perceive; that things, bad as they were, would have been worse but for such interposition, and that both her mother and <MASK> were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence and vulgarity. In every argument with her mother, <MASK> had in point of reason the advantage, and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off. The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had never known. There",Austen
1525,6412," couple in the world, I think I shall soon know where to look for them."" ""You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,"" said Elinor, with a faint smile. ""Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as ever I saw."" ""He spoke of its being out of repair."" ""Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he repair it?--who should do it but himself?"" They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. <MASK> immediately preparing to go, said,--",Austen
1526,1830," and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes one feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as a wife, Sir <MASK> <MASK> as a husband, are my standards of perfection. Poor <MASK> has been sadly taken in, and yet there was nothing improper on her side: she did not run into the match inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took three days to consider of his proposals, and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having,",Austen
1527,4130," caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense. She had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her good. It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands. She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness",Austen
1528,4871," It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. <MASK> her sister's being in town. Four weeks passed away, and <MASK> saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow <MASK> to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister",Austen
1529,3962," the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification. Captain <MASK> was no reader; but he had contrived excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick. His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within. He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued;",Austen
1530,3216," was always best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided, and thus spoke-- “Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?” “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so",Austen
1531,5586," and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it. The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. <MASK> had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son,",Austen
1532,4880," and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. <MASK> and <MASK> take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.” Chapter 27 With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks",Austen

A few weeks, he believed. “When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. <MASK> said her mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.” Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years",Austen
1534,2629," depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently,",Austen
1535,4641," was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them. But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. <MASK> concerning whose return from London <MASK> came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered",Austen
1536,4203," waiting, and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a ""Good morning to you!"" being all that she had time for, as she passed away. As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's party began talking of them. ""Mr <MASK> does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?"" ""Oh! no, that is clear enough. One can guess what will happen there. He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe. What a very good-looking man!""",Austen
1537,3348," of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. <MASK> had sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. <MASK> <MASK> having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, <MASK> had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the ostler",Austen
1538,4944," soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out: “What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.” “We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply. “Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,",Austen
1539,1828," to get married, and wants <MASK> to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to such a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an idea of the _sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to answer! Poor <MASK> <MASK> will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish <MASK> were married, for my poor friend's sake, for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it was a most desirable match",Austen
1540,5028," connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the",Austen
1541,1672," overlooked the deficiencies of her apartment, till he, stopping short as he entered, said, with much surprise, “Why have you no fire to-day?” There was snow on the ground, and she was sitting in a shawl. She hesitated. “I am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year.” “But you have a fire in general?” “No, sir.” “How comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable. In your bedchamber I know you _cannot_ have a fire. Here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified. It is",Austen
1542,5551," thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.” He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come for <MASK> or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.” Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable",Austen
1543,1920," hoped. On her father, her confidence had not been sanguine, but he was more negligent of his family, his habits were worse, and his manners coarser, than she had been prepared for. He did not want abilities but he had no curiosity, and no information beyond his profession; he read only the newspaper and the navy-list; he talked only of the dockyard, the harbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank; he swore and he drank, he was dirty and gross. She had never been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness in his former treatment of herself. There had remained only a general impression of",Austen
1544,843," and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister's. She had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her: she had fixed on <MASK> <MASK> the eldest son of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds, with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. <MASK> foresaw in her; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved woman, <MASK> had not been three hours in the house before she told her what she had planned. Miss <MASK> was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them,",Austen
1545,212," containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back. “Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare! They are coming for me perhaps--but I shall not go--I cannot go indeed, for you know Miss <MASK> may still call.” Mrs. <MASK> agreed to it. <MASK> <MASK> was soon with them, and his voice was with them yet sooner, for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss <MASK> to be quick. “Make haste! Make haste!” as he threw open the door. “Put on your hat this moment--there is no time to be lost--we are going to Bristol. How d'ye do, Mrs. Allen?” “To Bristol! Is",Austen
1546,10," So far her improvement was sufficient--and in many other points she came on exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she brought herself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own composition, she could listen to other people's performance with very little fatigue. Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil--she had no notion of drawing--not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover's profile, that she might be detected in the design. There she fell miserably short of the true",Austen
1547,2191," their home was the home of affection and comfort; and to complete the picture of good, the acquisition of Mansfield living, by the death of Dr. <MASK> occurred just after they had been married long enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feel their distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience. On that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage there, which, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had never been able to approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm, soon grew as dear to her heart, and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, as",Austen
1548,3979," blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced. It was evident that the gentleman, (completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly. Captain <MASK> looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it. He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, ""That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like <MASK> <MASK> again."" After attending <MASK> through her business, and loitering about a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards quickly from",Austen
1549,5208," much better acquainted with Mr. <MASK> than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry. Of Mr. <MASK> it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was",Austen
1550,2743," which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, <MASK> observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell. The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again; and Miss <MASK> receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and unattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily",Austen
1551,2148," could have been expected, and for his sake been more near doing right. Fanny thought exactly the same; and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect, the indelible impression, which such a disappointment must make on his mind. Time would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a sort of thing which he never could get entirely the better of; and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could--it was too impossible to be named but with indignation. Fanny's friendship was all that he had to cling to. CHAPTER XLVIII Let other pens",Austen
1552,2865," said Mrs. Weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give <MASK> such a respectable home.” “If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss <MASK> belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--'So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!' And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's old petticoat. 'Not that it was such a very old petticoat",Austen
1553,3458," ought not to be.' 'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'” “Poor girl!” said <MASK> again. “She loves him then excessively, I suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her judgment.” “Yes, I have no",Austen
1554,264," “I do not care. Mr. <MASK> had no business to invent any such message. If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss <MASK> myself. This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know that Mr. <MASK> has--He may be mistaken again perhaps; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday. Let me go, Mr. Thorpe; Isabella, do not hold me.” <MASK> told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were turning the corner into <MASK> Street, when he had overtaken them, and were at home by this time. “Then I will go after them,” said",Austen

You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to",Austen
1556,4077," been to leave his card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct, such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was completely re-established. They had not a fault to find in him. He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side. It had originated in misapprehension entirely. He had never had an idea of throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and delicacy had",Austen
1557,5454," went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. <MASK> returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence. <MASK> was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. <MASK> spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than",Austen
1558,4925," share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.” “Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?” “With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.” Lady <MASK> seemed quite astonished at not",Austen
1559,1574," confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while Miss <MASK> wondered she did not smile, and thought her over-anxious, or thought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of pleasure in Henry's attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the evening; but Henry's attentions had very little to do with it. She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again so very soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for the sake of securing her at that part of the",Austen
1560,3241," We really must wish you good night.” Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. <MASK> thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank <MASK> was looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. <MASK> could not tell. He remained at Hartfield after all the rest,",Austen
1561,678," tea with us, and I always thought him a great addition, he is so very agreeable. I have a notion you danced with him, but am not quite sure. I remember I had my favourite gown on.” <MASK> could not answer; and, after a short trial of other subjects, Mrs. <MASK> again returned to--“I really have not patience with the general! Such an agreeable, worthy man as he seemed to be! I do not suppose, Mrs. Morland, you ever saw a better-bred man in your life. His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them, Catherine. But no wonder; Milsom Street, you know.” As they walked home again,",Austen
1562,266," what had passed. It was painful to her to disappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her brother; but she could not repent her resistance. Setting her own inclination apart, to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney, to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before, and on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. She had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted merely her own gratification; that might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she had",Austen
1563,2403," very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon now.” She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions. “What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman? And woman,",Austen
1564,2863," what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of <MASK> <MASK> is always glad to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making. You do it very ill. <MASK> <MASK> mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so mad a thing.” “Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.” “But Mr.",Austen
1565,3002," a different thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her 'Augusta.' How delightful!” When the visit was returned, <MASK> made up her mind. She could then see more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly",Austen
1566,3236," Mr. <MASK> so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work. She was sitting by Mr. <MASK> and turned to him for help. The word was _blunder_; and as <MASK> exultingly proclaimed it, there",Austen
1567,5854," His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull. CHAPTER 18 Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he was unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her",Austen

The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?” “Just as they always do--very vulgar.” “They told me something,” said <MASK> rather hesitatingly; “but it is nothing of any consequence.” <MASK> was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton. “They told me--that Mr. <MASK> dined with them last Saturday.”",Austen

Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.” This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like regret. She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,",Austen

They saw nothing of <MASK> till dinner time, when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word. Her eyes were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst into tears and",Austen

She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to <MASK> altogether much more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them. This would",Austen

""We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, which cannot be said now."" And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private. ""But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?"" ""I was engaged",Austen
1573,5495," particular to say to you, Lizzy?” <MASK> was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible. Chapter 57 The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw <MASK> into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report",Austen

1576,3995," all her attention as long as attention was possible. It was soon drawn, perforce another way. There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth. In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; the sensation was delightful to her. The hardness of the pavement for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it, however. She was",Austen
1577,4128," moving from one to the other without assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath. Yet, in spite of all this, <MASK> had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment. How could it be? She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only. A submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that",Austen
1578,4536," country-town indifference to decorum.” “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley. “I am afraid, Mr. <MASK> observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.” “Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. <MASK> began again: “I have an excessive regard for Miss <MASK> <MASK> she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am",Austen
1579,5481," mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.” “Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. <MASK> is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?” “Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.” Lady <MASK> hesitated for a moment, and then replied: “The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in",Austen
1580,736," you are not against it, I will write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield; _you_ shall have no trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never regard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler's, and the child be appointed to meet her there. They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach, under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going. I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman's wife or other going",Austen
1581,4804," I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.” They were all astonished; and Mr. <MASK> who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said: “But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.” “My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.” “You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her",Austen
1582,1325," accomplishments, her spirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford's kind opinion of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, and she began to talk of something else. “To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr. <MASK> too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth.” “That is impossible, Fanny. He must like him less after to-morrow's visit, for we shall be five hours in his company. I should dread the stupidity of the day, if",Austen

What would be the consequence? Whom would it not injure? Whose views might it not affect? Whose peace would it not cut up for ever? Miss Crawford, herself, Edmund; but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread such ground.

It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima. Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone. An excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne. I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly. You can send for us, you know, at a moment's",Austen

Mrs <MASK> made no reply; but when she was leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, ""Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you."" <MASK> was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.

After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by either. ""Pray be quick, sir,""--said Elinor, impatiently;--""I have no time to spare."" He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to hear her. ""Your sister,"" said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--""is out of danger. I heard it",Austen
1622,6506," reward in store, for every present inconvenience. The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, <MASK> would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be",Austen
1623,4467," for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous. The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. <MASK> had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. <MASK> had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. <MASK> was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. <MASK> felt Jane's pleasure. <MASK> had heard herself mentioned to Miss <MASK> as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and <MASK> and <MASK> had been fortunate enough never to be",Austen
1624,1089," and he did come rather earlier than had been expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had left Weymouth to join. He came on the wings of disappointment, and with his head full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the play in which he had borne a part was within two days of representation, when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers. To be so near happiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in praise of",Austen

Come, do change your mind. It is not too late. Go into the law.” “Go into the law! With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness.” “Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you.” “You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _bon_ _mot_, for there is not the least wit in my",Austen

But, suppose he had made her very much in love with him?” “But we must first suppose <MASK> to have had a heart to lose--consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that case, she would have met with very different treatment.” “It is very right that you should stand by your brother.” “And if you would stand by yours, you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe. But your mind is warped by an innate",Austen

I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.” Mrs. Weston's communications furnished <MASK> with more food for unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her sense of past injustice towards Miss",Austen
1628,1073," but since the day at Sotherton, she could never see Mr. <MASK> with either sister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure; and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in every other respect, had she been sure that she was seeing clearly, and judging candidly, she would probably have made some important communications to her usual confidant. As it was, however, she only hazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. “I am rather surprised,” said she, “that Mr. <MASK> should come back again so soon, after being here so long before, full",Austen
1629,980," and for how confined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They have been buried, I suppose, in the parish church. _There_ you must look for the banners and the achievements.” “It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.” Mrs. <MASK> began her relation. “This chapel was fitted up as you see it, in <MASK> the Second's time. Before that period, as I understand, the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat",Austen

""Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than Mr. <MASK> wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don't think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think you both",Austen
1631,6193," this conversation were repeated by Miss <MASK> to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that <MASK> appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But though this behaviour assured <MASK> that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect",Austen
1632,311," and a Sophia to console her, she bade her adieu without much uneasiness, and returned home, pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it, and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either <MASK> or <MASK> to resent her resistance any longer. CHAPTER 15 Early the next day, a note from Isabella, speaking peace and tenderness in every line, and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance, hastened Catherine, in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity, to Edgar's Buildings. The two",Austen

Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close",Austen
1634,3842," alienations, removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past-- how natural, how certain too! It included nearly a third part of her own life. Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing. Now, how were his sentiments to be read? Was this like wishing to avoid her? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question. On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss <MASK> had",Austen
1635,3981," his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good manners. He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an agreeable person. <MASK> felt that she should like to know who he was. They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to the window. It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle, but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going away. It was driven by a servant in mourning. The word curricle made <MASK> <MASK> jump up that he might compare it with",Austen
1636,163," Street again, induced her, in some small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure. When they arrived at Mrs. Allen's door, the astonishment of <MASK> was hardly to be expressed, on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house: “Past three o'clock!” It was inconceivable, incredible, impossible! And she would neither believe her own watch, nor her brother's, nor the servant's; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality, till <MASK> produced his watch, and ascertained the",Austen
1637,2537," with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. <MASK> had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each. This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not",Austen
1638,6372," had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my cousin <MASK> said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. <MASK> would be off; and when <MASK> did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart <MASK> gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once <MASK> thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that. However this morning he came just as",Austen
1639,2828," else. _Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.” “Nonsensical girl!” was his reply, but not at all in anger. <MASK> had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated",Austen
1640,3086," seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it _had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been in vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits. She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--but she abstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt <MASK>",Austen
1641,4046," their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I never go near."" Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer, and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up the subject again, to say-- ""The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place. The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only when the wind",Austen
1642,280," her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself, if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety, only to enable her to be guilty of another? CHAPTER 14 The next morning was fair, and <MASK> almost expected another attack from the assembled party. With Mr. <MASK> to support her, she felt no dread of the event: but she would gladly be spared a contest, where victory itself was painful, and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them. The <MASK> called for her at the appointed time; and no new difficulty arising, no sudden",Austen
1643,1963," of the manner in which Mr. <MASK> must be struck. He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether. He must soon give her up, and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match; and yet, though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever, agreeable man, than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations. Mr. <MASK> probably could not regard his",Austen
1644,1838," possible. If any man ever loved a woman for ever, I think <MASK> will do as much for you.” Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say. “I cannot imagine <MASK> ever to have been happier,” continued <MASK> <MASK> <MASK> when he had succeeded in getting your brother's commission.” She had made a sure push at Fanny's feelings here. “Oh! yes. How very, very kind of him.” “I know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know the parties he had to move. The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours; and there are so many young men's claims to be attended to in the",Austen
1645,774," outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him. To the education of her daughters <MASK> <MASK> paid not the smallest attention. She had not time for such cares. She was a woman who spent her days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece of needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pug than her children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas, and in smaller concerns by her sister. Had she possessed greater",Austen
1646,6270," the whole evening. ""Poor Marianne!"" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,-- ""She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but <MASK> WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.-- Now you see it is all gone."" CHAPTER 35 Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. <MASK> was satisfied.-- She",Austen
1647,2587," turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield. There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--and in strange hands--a mere common",Austen
1648,2753," must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there. “Will Mr. <MASK> <MASK> pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”--was a question, however, which did not augur much. But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and <MASK> was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time. The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that she was to think of her at four. “My dear, dear anxious",Austen
1649,1046," anxiety could authorise. His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet, and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November. <MASK> was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the father brought a husband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to throw a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she should",Austen
1650,834," faultless--an angel; and, of course, so surrounded by admirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, as far as Mrs. <MASK> could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance, Mr. <MASK> appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her. After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young people justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction of their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the",Austen
1651,4370," with every advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs <MASK> could not give, could be properly interesting only to the principals. Mrs <MASK> was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it was very sensibly. <MASK> hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear. ""And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,"" said Mrs Musgrove, in her powerful whisper, ""though we could have wished it different, yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for <MASK> <MASK> was quite wild about it, and <MASK> was pretty near as bad;",Austen

It puzzled her to account for all this. It could not be General Tilney's fault. That he was perfectly agreeable and good-natured, and altogether a very charming",Austen
1653,5736," were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them. Mrs. <MASK> entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her it was but",Austen

Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage",Austen
1655,3749," and their business no evil. She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it. She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the",Austen

Mrs. <MASK> could only approve. <MASK> then went to Emma; but <MASK> could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. <MASK> who had left the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. He had gone beyond the sweep--some way along the",Austen
1657,1544," <MASK> struggled for speech, and said, “I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My uncle meant it so.” “Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure. It will all end right. I am only vexed for a moment. In fact, it is not that I consider the ball as ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny,” stopping her, by taking her hand, and speaking low and seriously, “you know what all this means. You see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell you, how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little. You are a",Austen

Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech. He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated sitting",Austen
1659,5839," him; for his coming to <MASK> was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural. Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. He received the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not stand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and <MASK> had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself. His affections",Austen

The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. <MASK> began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy. “I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when",Austen
1661,3452," much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded. A little curiosity <MASK> had; and she made the most of it while her friend related. Mrs. <MASK> had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr. <MASK> could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering",Austen

Mr. <MASK> will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out of sight.” “Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.” Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort to prevent it. “You will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram,” she cried; “you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had",Austen

His words seemed to imply it. Could he have <MASK> <MASK> in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in",Austen
1665,1423," enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself, for we are a great deal together.” And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left <MASK> to her fate, a fate which, had not Fanny's heart been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she deserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young ladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent, manner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them, or to",Austen

What would I not give to see it again?” “Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,” was his answer; “but I fear there would be some disappointment: you would not find it equal to your present ideas.

Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just reached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received an addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss Crawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage. They were young people of fortune. The son had a good",Austen

At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs, by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery. She had no power to move. With a feeling of terror not very definable, she fixed her eyes on the staircase, and in a few moments it gave <MASK> to her view. “Mr. Tilney!” she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment. He looked astonished too. “Good God!” she continued, not attending to",Austen

Mr. <MASK> accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.

For half an hour Mr. <MASK> was surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner. These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a",Austen

As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion",Austen

At length, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate should be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With this spirit she sprang forward, and her",Austen

She had hoped that, to a man like her uncle, so discerning, so honourable, so good, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_ on her side would have been sufficient. To her infinite grief she found it was not. Sir <MASK> came towards the table where she sat in trembling wretchedness, and with a good deal of cold sternness, said, “It is of no use, I perceive, to talk to you.",Austen

But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture. Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. <MASK> with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his",Austen

She was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her walk and going into the East room again, the first thing which caught her eye was a fire lighted and burning. A fire! it seemed too much; just at that time to be giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude. She wondered that Sir <MASK> could have leisure to think of such a trifle again; but she soon found, from the voluntary information of the housemaid, who came in to attend",Austen
1707,2233," welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her. She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear <MASK> was of no feeble",Austen

I cannot give her up, Fanny. She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife.

The husband had not been what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved. It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon added in a different tone-- ""I do not suppose the situation my friend <MASK> <MASK> is in at present, will furnish much either to interest or edify me. She is only nursing <MASK> <MASK> of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,",Austen

There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr. <MASK> would never believe it. CHAPTER III Mr. <MASK> was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he",Austen

It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters? ""It was my father's last request to me,"" replied her husband, ""that I should assist his",Austen

I shall leave you together. There is no use in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”--And <MASK> distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--“I have been as good as my word. She has not the least idea.” Mrs. <MASK> was looking",Austen

Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them, and <MASK> had time for only one thrill of horror, before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement. He was engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next; he had met with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied; he should have the honour, however, of waiting on them again on the morrow, etc., and so they parted--Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil!

Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him. He pressed for the strictest forbearance and silence towards their niece; she not only promised, but did observe it. She only looked her increased ill-will.

I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is.

Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very formidable.

They were relieved by it from all restraint; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach. Fanny's relief, and her consciousness of it, were quite equal to her cousins'; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful, and she really grieved because she could not grieve. “Sir Thomas, who had done so much for her",Austen

When she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to",Austen

As far as she could judge, Mr. <MASK> was considerably the best actor of all: he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom, more talent and taste than Mr. Yates. She did not like him as a man, but she must admit him to be the best actor, and on this point there were not many who differed from her. Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his tameness and insipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr. <MASK> turned to her with a black look, and said, “Do you think there is anything so",Austen

After this had been settled, Colonel <MASK> began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a",Austen

To Mr. <MASK> <MASK> was she indebted for her first idea on the subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying that those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. <MASK> had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. <MASK> would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much",Austen

I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father there for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she certainly knew all.

It was spoken with enthusiasm. ""Had you?"" cried he, catching the same tone; ""I honour you!"" And there was silence between them for a little while. <MASK> could not immediately fall into a quotation again.

He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued: “I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.'

She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and drown her voice.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. <MASK> attending them to point out its beauties, and <MASK> <MASK> kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the",Austen

It was a sort of playing at being frightened. The sufferings which Lady <MASK> did not see had little power over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortably about agitation, and anxiety, and poor",Austen

But then again, the dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her, for she presently added, ""Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!""

And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement. He says so in this letter, says that he as good as made you an offer, and that you received his advances in the kindest way; and now he wants me to urge his suit, and say all manner of pretty things to you. So it is in vain to affect ignorance.” Catherine, with all the earnestness of truth, expressed her",Austen

For Fanny's present comfort it was concluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he been able to talk another five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talked away all Miss Crawford's faults and his own despondence. But as it was, they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection, and with some very precious sensations on hers. She had felt nothing like it for hours. Since the first joy from Mr. <MASK> note to <MASK> had worn away, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had",Austen

She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.” “If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. <MASK> in them.” “Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you know, of",Austen
1783,2929," people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. <MASK> <MASK> and Miss <MASK> danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with <MASK> <MASK> even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold--and",Austen
1784,5892," as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. <MASK> laughed so heartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. <MASK> looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and then returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them. ""Oh! dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at them for ever."" And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the",Austen

I only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not.

This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened: ""ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.",Austen

As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table: “This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.” Then, perceiving in <MASK> no inclination of replying, she added, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false",Austen

Mrs. <MASK> was most zealous in promoting the match, by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party; and, among other means, by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman's mother, who at present lived with him, and to whom",Austen

The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and all that poor <MASK> would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.

Towards this home, she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses <MASK> to accompany her. Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year. Mrs. <MASK> received the",Austen
1791,1413," united, and the chief talkers attracting each other, she remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formed after tea--formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his attentive wife, though it was not to be supposed so--and Miss <MASK> took her harp, she had nothing to do but to listen; and her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening, except when Mr. <MASK> now and then addressed to her a question or observation, which she could not avoid answering. Miss <MASK> was too much vexed by what had passed to be in a humour for anything but music. With that she",Austen

I think we are a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves, and doing nothing.” Sir <MASK> looked again, and then replied with an approving smile, “I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It gives me sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and quick-sighted, and feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel, is perfectly natural; and equally so that my value for",Austen

One thing, especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!--but it would be impossible to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey's guardian."" ""It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss <MASK> has",Austen

That he was a sensible man, an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough. He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct. She distrusted the past, if not the present. The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the allusions to",Austen

It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley. It must be her ardent wish that <MASK> might be disappointed; and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it",Austen

Why did such an idea occur to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden? It ought not to have touched on the confines of her imagination. She would endeavour to be rational, and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford's character, and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart. She had all the heroism of principle, and was determined to do her duty; but having also many",Austen
1797,400," readily as they were offered, and allowing him almost an equal share with <MASK> in her notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive to be passed over. What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend could be at, was beyond her comprehension. <MASK> could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which <MASK> could not but resent. <MASK> was the sufferer. She saw him grave and uneasy; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart, to her it was always an object. For poor",Austen

They had talked, and they had been silent; he had reasoned, she had ridiculed; and they had parted at last with mutual vexation. Fanny, not able to refrain entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied. It was barbarous to be happy when <MASK> was suffering. Yet some",Austen

Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his manners pleasing.” <MASK>",Austen

There seemed a general diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. <MASK> was enjoying such an advance towards the end; <MASK> was in spirits from the morning's rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away. All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only the arrival of Mrs. <MASK> and the <MASK>",Austen

He was very much pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, <MASK> still more, and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it.

Why do you choose that cold, damp path to it? Miss <MASK> will get wet. Our best way is across the park.” “This is so favourite a walk of mine,” said Miss Tilney, “that I always think it the best and nearest way. But perhaps it may be damp.” It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs; and Catherine,",Austen

But “she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that",Austen

As for _his_ going, <MASK> did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned. “I am not fond of dinner-visiting,” said he--“I never was. No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. <MASK> should",Austen

Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste of the furniture. Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after. Everybody was wanting to visit them. They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing. Here",Austen

It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. <MASK> does not feel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may be said in her situation for even that error!” “Much, indeed!” cried <MASK>",Austen

I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. “The part which I acted is now to be explained.

There was no second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford; there was no intelligence from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her to hear again from her aunt. This was an evil omen. She had, indeed, scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her mind, and was reduced to so low and wan and trembling a condition, as no mother, not unkind, except Mrs. Price could have overlooked, when the third day did bring the sickening knock,",Austen

Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends, as he had then hoped, his disorder increased considerably, and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield. “This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,” observed her ladyship, after giving the substance of it, “has agitated us exceedingly, and we cannot prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor",Austen

She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom",Austen

Mr. <MASK> began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. “It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.

They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment. <MASK> was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed",Austen

But then it was such a dead time of year, no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the country. And it all ended, at last, in his",Austen

To come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would always wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can.

He had returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. <MASK> for some time. Mr. <MASK> had a cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and her",Austen

As Mrs. <MASK> could talk on no other subject, <MASK> soon saw the necessity of preparing <MASK> for its discussion.

She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.

All went well: she did not dislike her own looks; and when she came to the necklaces again, her good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given her by Miss <MASK> would by no means go through the ring of the cross.

Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in a moment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification; and the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies, and the barking of Pug in his mistress's arms.

""But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how it",Austen

The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another the lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after hour passed away, and the wearied <MASK> had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep.

Mr. <MASK> looked at her with astonishment. “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.” “Miss <MASK> <MASK> said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.” “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.” “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite",Austen

She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to try to observe their effect. It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; <MASK> only reserving the advantage of still",Austen

The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.” She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. <MASK> had a house. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except",Austen

But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. <MASK> said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire",Austen

I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as",Austen

When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected. Had she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of",Austen

In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment. In time, of course, Mr. <MASK> would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.

But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which <MASK> was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty. In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.

I could name three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank me.” “Ha!” cried Mary; “settle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then we shall be all together.” When she had spoken it, she recollected herself, and wished it unsaid; but there was no need of",Austen

In his preceding attempts to attach himself to <MASK> <MASK> (the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own. There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of",Austen
1906,1215," angry consolations. The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy: they were alienated from each other; and <MASK> was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there, some punishment to <MASK> for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth. With no material fault of temper, or difference of opinion, to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the same, the sisters, under such a trial as this, had not affection or principle enough to make them",Austen

It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and thought it",Austen

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent",Austen

Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone.

He was posting away as if upon life and death, and could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all were.” “It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing.” “_That_ is Miss Maria's concern.

She told her story. “Poor dear Fanny,” cried her cousin, “how ill",Austen

She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded. A day or two",Austen

She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend. There had been the charm. She had sought him. Without that attraction, not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir <MASK> was, moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman. Here was a great deal to soften the business. A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him! Sir <MASK> seemed to admit it as complete apology; and",Austen
1940,237," her amenable. Dejected and humbled, she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance, for she soon recollected, in the first place, that she was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the second, that it was a play she wanted very much to see. To the theatre accordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her; she feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness for plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were habituated to",Austen

A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition in little Charles. She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening. As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind",Austen

I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.” Mr. <MASK> who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His",Austen
1943,5650," surprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated, ""Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to what part of it?"" She explained the situation. It was within four miles northward of Exeter. ""It is but a cottage,"" she continued, ""but I hope to see many of my friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find none in accommodating them."" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. <MASK> <MASK> to visit her at Barton; and to <MASK> she gave one",Austen

When the general had satisfied his own curiosity, in a close examination of every well-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an apartment, in its way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection of books, on which an humble man might have looked with pride. Catherine heard, admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before--gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running over the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed. But suites of",Austen
1946,2166," regretted by no one at Mansfield. She had never been able to attach even those she loved best; and since Mrs. Rushworth's elopement, her temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her everywhere tormenting. Not even <MASK> had tears for aunt Norris, not even when she was gone for ever. That <MASK> escaped better than <MASK> was owing, in some measure, to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance, but in a greater to her having been less the darling of that very aunt, less flattered and less spoilt. Her beauty and acquirements had held but a second place. She had",Austen

(End of volume one.) Chapter 13 The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross,",Austen

She had no dread of these two months. <MASK> was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort. She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion. <MASK>",Austen

The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and <MASK> bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.

But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.” “My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.” “Has your governess left you?” “We never had any governess.” “No governess!

Still Mrs. <MASK> was at intervals urging something different; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England, when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height, she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup. “Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea. Do have a basin of soup.” Sir <MASK> could not be provoked. “Still the same anxiety for everybody's comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,” was his answer. “But indeed I would rather have",Austen

Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. <MASK> as one cannot but value.” “Yes,” said Mr. <MASK> <MASK> presently, with some slyness, “he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.” “Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?” “Such an",Austen

I am sure of having their opinions with me.” “I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise",Austen

These ten ages at least. I am sure I have been here this half hour. But now, let us go and sit down at the other end of the room, and enjoy ourselves. I have an hundred things to say to you. In the first place, I was so afraid it would rain this morning, just as I wanted to set off; it looked very showery, and that would have thrown me into agonies!

Their hearts are open to each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave, he added, “Though <MASK> does not leave Bath with us, he will probably remain but a very short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. His leave of absence will soon expire, and he must return to his regiment. And what will then be",Austen

Mary talked, but she could not attend. She had seen him. They had met. They had been once more in the same room. Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less. Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up. How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness! What might not eight years do? Events of every description,",Austen

He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it. “Read it, read it,” said he, “it will give you pleasure; only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.” The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to every body. “Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?--Anne, my dear, did not",Austen

She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how the rooms were attended; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella's having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which she had left her intent; and of her continuing on the best terms with James. Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella. <MASK> had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford; and Mrs. <MASK> had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton. But",Austen

To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she had never before for",Austen

The play should not be lost by _his_ absence. “From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,” said he; “I will attend you from any place in England, at an hour's notice.” It was well at that moment that <MASK> had to speak, and not his sister. He could immediately say with easy fluency, “I am sorry you are going; but as to our play, _that_ is all over--entirely at an end” (looking significantly at his father). “The painter was sent off yesterday, and very little will remain of the",Austen

Think of your mother; think of her misery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself."" ""I cannot, I cannot,"" cried Marianne; ""leave me, leave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so. Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion! Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an",Austen

They talked for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged <MASK> to turn round. It came from Mr Elliot. He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to explain Italian again. Miss <MASK> was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung. <MASK> could not refuse; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit. A few minutes, though as few as",Austen

Her colour changed, and she said no more. Mrs. <MASK> was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. “What",Austen

If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately."" While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door. Who could it be? Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot, would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off. After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard, and ""Mr and <MASK> <MASK>",Austen

Reflection had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby's deserts;--she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray. In the evening, when they were all three together, <MASK> began voluntarily to speak of him again;--but that it was not without an effort, the",Austen

I saw you first in February.” And then whispering--“Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk.

She did not seem to have a thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began, six years ago come next Easter.

He was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operating on an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made her affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and determined him to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing her to love him. He would not despair: he would not",Austen

Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.

To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford.” “Aye, that will be much best,” said Harriet, quite satisfied, “I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.” Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs. <MASK> and Miss <MASK> met them at the door. “My dear Miss",Austen

He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back again to <MASK> <MASK> that he may be within call when Mrs. <MASK> is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care.

It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as windows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from",Austen

I thought I should have broken my heart.” “I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia. “If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet. “Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!

Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray such a preference of her uncle's house.

Madame de Belliere was pale, trembling, and full of respectful attentions for madame la surintendante, who, with one hand on her husband’s, was looking anxiously towards the door by which <MASK> had gone out to bring D’Artagnan.
