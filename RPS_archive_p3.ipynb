I stayed with them for two days, taking several small drowsy pills, the result of which was a complete drowsiness, while they examined by means of a sensitive, inquisitive, curious, and pretty young woman known to be exceedingly good with young girls. I said I wanted to see her and was sent away with a small amount of money, and when I returned to the hotel they found one-third of my clothes on my father's dressing-table.\n",

There was a small table in which, in order to avoid being embarrassed, I was to take my watch which she was to examine, but I did not take it.

She sat down beside me and started to talk; I thought I was talking to the most famous actress in the world, to some other person; and she had a certain kind of talk, too. She made reference to a man she had married years ago and she was talking about a boy who had gone for two years without seeing his family. The boy? I knew I heard that name. He was a student, with a fine family, and her mother had died some years before, a few years before her marriage. He had a beautiful boy named Bouteillan who died in 1871, and he was a famous actor, a star of the stage - and I never saw Bouteillan, I was the youngest artist. She continued to talk. I stood up and said 'I have a request. Do you know of any girl who wants to marry a famous actor?' She made a face.\n",

'No, look here, look here, darling, I will never be afraid.' She turned to the old fool, and, as I looked at her, I saw in her eyes something I will never forget: that very evening, after a long and very sad dinner, she had sent me for a new dress and the letter from my schoolmates. My little darling (my only child) looked very different from her father then, had a pince-nez in her mouth as she looked at me with tears in her eyes, and wore a strange silk hat that had been made for her by her mother. On her mother's advice it was too late to get a haircut and no one except her father saw us at home, and so we could not see her at school.\n",

      " illustrious young men, who had already left me and then suddenly vanished from view.\n",
      "\n",
      "We moved out of the house along Main Street, took a small black-colored bus, and went back to my flat, where a big manor seemed almost to stand tall above the rest of the square, a large square in front of which we found a square church, which we passed with a slow shuffle, and a corner of the churchyard was covered with the grey dust that falls on St. Andrew’s Day. All in search of the river. “Why d’you ask” exclaimed a young woman sitting on the railings, “what is your name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied that I was the daughter, and asked her. All she had on was one silk-soled dress, her small face with its crooked features, and the small, white-pale eyes in their dull gold-studded sockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to tell you something,” I continued. “I was once in a kind of a hurry in the matter of a shop. One morning I wanted to get one of their things that they had forgotten on the road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why in the world would I want them to get my shit,” answered the woman. “Well, they’ve gone on with it anyway, and the train had left them alone. Well, one afternoon I wanted them to go to the library.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And’s what I’ll do;” said the young woman with a certain smile, “ I’ll help you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was the first to see the letter. My hand went to the top of a pile of papers and made a long cross on the black one. A few months after my marriage, my husband had started to keep track of letters of a general nature and was, I thought, a very poor editor. The last one that his handwriting had retained was from us. We had met, and he began by saying he had written you and me a few days before the marriage that “a kind of little letter,” “but only in that way ... I was writing to you as a general person.... I do not want to go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you were reading a book,” commented an elderly lady. “But in reality you were reading me an awful and pathetic letter of the kind we talked about the other day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll look into it,” said my husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said the lady and gave me one of those blank looks she associates with the Russian lady, “we’ll look into it.” “Yes, but why now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not before?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They kept writing: ‘I have come ... They kept writing: ‘To you I have had ... The first letter was from us,’ and I cannot express to you the kind of tender feeling which this letter gave us ...”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There you are again,” whispered my husband. And that was all! That was all for the letter! A beautiful, soft, sweet letter and the words I had just seen from him, the tender, sweet words. I have a feeling that at the time they read them they never saw those words before, since they are written so clearly, so precisely, that the reader of the letter finds the meaning of the letters. Then, too, in their style and mood the words seem more or less clear, and yet every word, every phrase, is a wonderful thing, and no wonder why, it was the best letters that my husband and I had.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was on the point of returning back, but I stood at the door and told him no, I could not come any nearer to the library on the second of August. I did not ask much though, I was rather apprehensive. His name was William Randolph.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My husband says he’s an actor” he said, “and if I go up to play myself, that would be all.”\n",

      "“Then he will be here as I have said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, so you already have the address?”\n",

      "“Oh yes, I can get it there,” said my husband with a sigh in reference to his reply. “But perhaps you might tell the driver about the little book.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had. He had arrived at the end of the platform and gone by several times. There was an iron ring on his shirt collar and he had turned over to the driver. The book he found was not in any way important to him yet. He wanted to know, however, whether the owner of\n",

      "“I’ll do my best,” said Van, “but it’s not very hard. It is a pity the music was not played.

So she said to her friends: No one has ever, in all my years of life, asked for an audience so the way they do now is very painful.”\n",

What do I have to say today?” — and he started to cry in a manner reminiscent of his father’s voice. “That was my mother’s song, but only the third and last of those she had composed—she never wrote the last. I remember you all so well, you know all she wrote, and your eyes look so young, and your neck so soft. So I have no objections with you about the way your song is, I think you did it well, I shall not object to one little thing\n",

Suddenly, because of something called “concentration,” he recognized the dim blush on her cheeks, and his voice, and the way she bent over her meal. “That’s not—” his wife stammered—and, with an imploring smile, she raised an eyebrow. A moment later, having noticed how she had been staring intently at her plate, the old man got up and left. “Good, good,” thought he, and laughed—at the world’s fate now, which will take care of itself—and then again—for how did you ask? And there was nothing more absurd than that little boy who had never even made friends with his old face. He had had a certain peculiar sort of connection with his old world, a special connection of an abnormal character, but this could only have been his special way of feeling that he would die—and the only thing that mattered was that he had lived.\n",

      "The reader should bear in mind that’s the name of a book, not the author. Moreover, this odd little book was not written by him but belonged to some other person. In view of this he suggested that he publish it as a pamphlet for his wife, and she, in the presence of her guests, read the whole thing in silence. What she did not understand was, as she pensively and timidly reflected that the author was crazy, she did not understand why he, a madman himself, should not be crazy too. And when it was only too late she understood that the old man meant to take all knowledge of the world, not any human word he spake, but the whole reality and essence of people and women, and the whole history of mankind, and then apply it to his own affairs only, for he was blind and stupid. She also did not understand that the author had a moralistic bent. He did not understand that the world might not have been as his wife suggested—and perhaps all that she was afraid of was that the world might not have existed after all.\n",

And she had no friends. Her husband was, after all, an old man, and the society at home consisted of her relatives, who are a few years older and much more sociable than she. They lived in an old villa with a large bed, a carpeted den and old wooden furniture. The only thing they had in common was that there was a great deal of wine. And the only time they spoke was in the evening—on the terrace of their vineyard, where all the grapes were singing under a golden sun, and one could see through the glass at the black, orange and green, green, with a hint of plum in the upper part at the neck of the young vines. All this was very old and very hard, and she kept seeing him, like a ghost, as if there had been a real person whom she could touch and see.\n",

He thought that, during her dream, she had not only slept herself to death but had killed herself—and thus killed herself that he should know her again. He thought this too, but in order to save time they tried the mirror, the light, the door, his voice, everything they could think of. After a while he realized that the woman was dead, and this horror\n",

This man was, in comparison, small and delicate and had a sort of taut, almost black, beard, with which most men tend to put on in the mornings. In my dreams I kept following the same man with whom I had slept all day—as he came out from the bathroom after running some errands. Every now and then, as we sat in one armchair, the light switch would flicker, and the bright reflection of the tablecloth would disappear—an entirely different world. My brother used to go on his knees in silence to the parlor of the hospital where he lived: the parlor contained an office with a green glass tablecloth and a green stool next to the bed-to-go.\n",

The letter turned out to be a very long one, and I had to wait quite a long time to receive it: a few days would pass, a few weeks, then, some ten months after I had come out of my dream.

Once, one morning before my father’s passing, I noticed a bright and familiar smell in the bed; he had gone to bed with his nephew in the house where I was staying, and was alone, thinking about something in the bedroom or in a tea shop when my brother came: he went with the same uncle from the hospital, and had asked me to come with him because he wanted his nephew alone, and because I lived with my uncle.\n",

That dream had nothing to do with his past, it was a distant past in general. When the room began to unfold, my brother said—we should say something to ourselves, to each other—let us imagine a great big empty hotel, a very tall one for his age—it was there that he had stayed when my father was dying. You recall that it was then, and there, in that hotel, that he would have married you.\n",

      " Jupiter, the last to arrive in New York in 1894. On the eve of the departure, he wrote on a telegram: “I would like also to say that I have had my heart operated on in a very successful manner.” In an envelope, stamped “Tiger,” he found a letter which read in part: “My love”—his own words—“My love, I am sorry but I can’t get rid of this thought. It’s a horrible thing. It’s very, very horrible.”\n",

It was an invisible thing he could find only by the sweat of his brow, by the steady and patient motion of his wrist. He read the letter for hours. The idea grew in the depths of his being, but he could not make it to the point of putting it into practice.\n",

On April 9th he telephoned her and said he was leaving in the morning (two days before his sister’s arrival at the country house). She rang up his friend but after giving the man a look of indifference he was unable to explain what would happen. In a few days he would go back and see her again (the other half of the journey, for example, would be a long journey by train). He had given up every other dream to become a successful writer; at the present stage he was content for the time being to sit for a while in a bar and ponder his hopeless predicament.\n",

      "It was now late spring of 1924 when she first met Karl. She remembered him as a lanky, burly man and as a shy little boy. She remembered him in some measure as a girl: as she rolled through the streets of Berlin, he would stop for her on the corner in the hope that she would pass under the open window, and, having lost her watch to look out as they went, she would raise her eyebrows, and she would laugh and take the lamp out of his hand, but she did not think at the time of his being a boy and if it did turn out that way later, it was now rather late, since she was not thinking at all. So it was at that moment that her love affair began. He met her almost on the street, as she was taking her mother for a shopping trip in the evening. On his way out of her door he bumped into her because she was coming home alone and he followed her, and as she turned into the street they bumped into each other. Karl was going at full speed and she was hurrying with Dreyer, and when he saw her he gave a start. When she was gone he tried to catch her hand in a patch of sunlight, but it was still fast and silent, and then he caught her shoulder. She turned so abruptly that it seemed like the hand was trying to creep over him, and yet she did not move, and he was quite alone, and he could make out the contours of her shoulder, which had gone dark under her thick black scarf, and that hand was still groping and groping as if there were some small object under the soles of her feet (one might say that she could stand a little sideways before the car, then she would quickly get into the front seat, but what was it that people used to do?), and in the car she felt it was impossible to breathe free, and then Karl seemed to go off to the corner and she heard the engine start. What looked like a car alarm was already receding—and that was all; there was but the briefest glow of a spark, as if someone had fallen in, and now the street was clear again: it had disappeared, there was a little green glade on its edge where Karl had paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never saw her again. He did not know why he had kept lying down on the street like that. One day, as he lay in bed—with Dreyer’s head on his pillow and his legs on a bench—his thoughts drifted past one day and one conversation, and then he started to tear up the remaining space between rows of rows in the dining-room, and there was no time for him to dozed on the bench, and Dreyer stood at the window: “\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, if I said to you and my brother, who knows all this all the time but who has not a penny, that we wanted to have somebody in France to look after our affairs, well you know what? I would get into trouble. Now I am not saying my brother or me should have behaved badly. My brother in certain respects behaved badly. And one day he told his friends, who have not met us on dry land, that there was somebody else whose father had not been a sailor but whom a sailor had taken him on as a child. And my brother then began to talk to him as if he were my father.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told it all to my brother and it was well known that nobody listened to him, and it was also known that nobody listened to me or my brother because everyone knew the truth, which is that my brother had been taken on as an apprentice, and had worked under a Russian sailor. In all honesty, I think I gave him the worst of everything in his attitude to him, which was such. So my advice would have been that if this was so, let us go and settle everything immediately. And I did say that I considered my brother's attitude as the worst of all possible methods of communication. When, however, I suggested to my brother that I should tell him in company and in a friendly tone that everybody had been taken on and was now preparing for a ship, I said to him in English, and he understood it as if he had said—oh, I must be going.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now I am to tell you how it all happened. My brother, who by now had grown sick of my mother’s cruelty, told you all about his affair with the sailor whose name he could not recall, and how on the eve of parting with her it had seemed to him that I should have done something about it. And then he left for London and was not seen again. Then I came there for a long time, worked in different establishments, went around the country for a while, and now you see how things came about.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you see how things really came about!” was my mother’s patter; you remember the patter, don’t you? She was trying to establish, for example, that the affair was not her husband’s affair, but that of the sailor’s father (he knew what my brother had done in the past). My mother told me not to worry about the sailor, as he had already left the sea. No, it was a different sort of affair, different in fact to the affair I had been contemplating with a queer fondness before you spoke of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now she told me how it all started. It happened at the office where she did business; it was a pretty old woman with a black eye and a small mole on her left temple. Her face was hollowed out and she had put on a brown hat with black hair, but this had been lost in the process of being pressed into shape by a kind of paste. I am not sure why my mother happened to be there, but I have overheard the maid tell her that someone named Olga (a sort of play on words, a combination of words like ‘olga,’ meaning “old” and ‘vozvrétstvenny, or old man’ meaning “young,” with the suffix ‘e’ for og’).\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother did not seem to know what she was talking about, although some other ladies in her presence used to ask her for advice and she kept saying “What can I do? It can't hurt to warn young fellows. It can’t hurt to let you know that somebody is about to marry a pretty lady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was, and still is, a dashing little creature. I can tell you a story about her. I was born in Berlin, first of all here. She was a pretty girl. She was quite bright and had a talent for singing, and one evening, in the middle of the night, she was found unconscious in her bedroom; a woman in black, with the hair down and the eyes fixed on her husband’s shoulder, stood in an open door and began to pounce upon her with her heels up and barking as she walked toward her husband.\n",

      " who was on the whole a very agreeable fellow, who, having a heart of gold, still felt the ripples and tremors of age. He had a sort of dull twinkle about him, and his hair was of the clean white kind that suits you by and large with a soft curl up near the temples. He stood, and sat, and coughed, and spat, and laughed—the type of laughter you expect from a clown, but which has no face, no face, no face whatsoever, no face at all, and a sort of strange pout. As he had done ever since first entering St. Petersburg, he started his talk, and the long-winded way that they had used every morning to start the day without him had now produced the perfect atmosphere of a man who wants to be heard, a man who has to make a long journey, someone who knows everything. And then there she was, in her shortish frock, with such a soft little dress, that he simply could not keep up with her, and, with that softness he had known, and the ease in which she clung with that easy, that charming, almost dreamy coarseness, he had managed to make the transition, to the point where he felt the familiar weightiness and the weariness of her figure. The rest was of course the usual dullity, and she was talking of some work to which he had just joined, about whose completion he had been invited, as the work would take place this spring. And at night he could not sleep, but that was not his fault: he was busy with his studies, and, by sleep's magic, this work was brought to a close—it had to be finished, and at their own pace a new chapter would be written out, and these chapters had to be finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all this was not all, they said, and he went on saying he was waiting anxiously for his meeting with her, eagerly anticipating it, trying to form that mysterious, almost dreamlike, attachment that had always haunted him—until the day that he broke it off in his old age. It had been as if, he said, he had been walking a very hard way for a long time, when suddenly he would meet those lovely little features, these small luminous patches in his skin, these little wrinkles, through which the light was shed, through which his whole life came alive, through everything that existed before it in the world, through everything that seemed to be changing. It was as if some invisible beam had penetrated his very marrow, and he no longer felt the body, and still not saw the body; for he had been lying quite dead for a long time, and now something happened now that caused him to suddenly awake, because he was in the throes of some urgent affair; and all this was in a sense related to a slight delay in the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he sat, and they talked about his studies, and he had to tell them, he said, that all this was his first assignment in this new school, and he had to take it very seriously. There was no such thing as the mere coincidence of circumstances, that was beyond him, because it was a special case, only a special kind of coincidence, and his imagination could do nothing about it. He was not interested in the things that happened to him—no matter how closely they connected themselves with the concrete past of the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "They said that since the old days of these days had been spent in an academy of art or medicine, they were glad to offer him their assistance now. They had learned to make, for example, beautiful, elegant candles, which were so delicate that they seemed capable of not falling apart, which happened to be even more precious than life itself; and yet they were quite new, and could be made even more so in their own way; and there it was in the shape of some exquisite object, or rather, a miniature version of some exquisite object with this minor imperfection, all in the margin of an otherwise extraordinary miniature.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was said that now there were so many wonderful things, that everything—even the crème brûlée of old men—now had a wonderful charm and a lovely, freshness of its own, and the makers were so expert, so cultured and so culturedly—but yet somehow, in their own fashion, they had lost touch with the essence of beauty, with the fact of beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt as though the word had lost all meaning, and it seemed less and less likely that he would ever find a worthy teacher—because the things in his hands were just as numerous and splendidly made as ever, they had lost all meaning, but yet he must look for a teacher whose tastes and ideas, whose work was far better—if he hoped to find the meaning, fulfilment, happiness and fulfillment that an education had to offer. For such a job there were not many available; they were as\n",

      " the white of his nose made the corners of his eyes look like an inverted triangle; the left side of his head was somewhat more plump, and the right one slightly longer than on the front of his head. He wore a black overcoat with a gray piqué collar, a black cap with a shiny top, and a black velvet bowler hat over his beige hair.\n",

      "The little table near which they sat contained a black-and-white lithograph of a man in a coat with a large poodle snout. At the far end of the table a small square window, with the glass shut, cast a broad, lustrous reflection. Lately he had become much better acquainted with the light in the office, for the yellow and blue of the windows, with the shadows on the furniture, with everything that lit up, were different from his own personal vision. While his companion was explaining the insides of the office, and L seemed, at least, to be using his eyes to see with his own eyes, Prince Krol were, by some subtle trick of perception, deceiving him as to the place where the company of the directors was supposed to be holding their meetings, and the manner in which that was to be accomplished in such a way as to appear as if the directors had been moved to some other place from which he could not distinguish them by their motions; for the directors were to be found in many places and the company of their meetings was also supposed to occupy some other place that he could not help noticing. He did not want to be there, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, there were the directors who had been elected in the last elections. The new committee chairs — the old ones were gone, but those whose presence the prince did not approve might make a bad beginning. This was the principle. The old committee members were, for the most part, old businessmen with the fatuous appearance of ordinary people; they wore expensive watch chains, and wore high shoes, and all seemed to look alike in the eyes of those who happened to join the old group and whose motions the princes of all countries had studied in detail: L in the first chair, followed by the old minister in second, the old president in third, the old coxcombed financier in fourth, the puffy and fatish deputy in fifth, finally the old manager in sixth, and finally the old member of the Chamber — always a fat and puffy old member of the Chamber. As soon as the prince left, all those members of the old committee, together with the new ones, were ushered into the new meeting hall to face the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "After their meetings there was to be no doubt that the old committee seats, and other details of the procedure, were destined to be discarded in the new one in preparation for which the prince hoped to find no more practical excuse than to assume a more or less fictitious situation, with his new committee members, when meeting at the appointed times and in the right positions, with all their essential details, and with all the meetings on the same principle. The meeting hall of the new committee was a gigantic marble space that was almost half of the present building, and consisted, like the auditorium of a palace, of floors and ceilings, and a ceiling for the whole building.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, Prince Krol — sitting on top of a giant globe in a small circular box, and leaning his head on the uppermost floor of two rooms next to the meeting hall — listened to those calls that every member of the old committee was obliged to make and then to recite and ponder over, his hands pressed to the temple and the small table at the far end, and the music of his heart beating like some strange beast, and the voice of L, his voice that had a special magical resonance when, in a different world, when he was on the brink of ecstasy, in the presence of all the world, the prince suddenly realized that his whole life he had been living, had been being living, and this had been a dream, a strange dream, and perhaps he himself was a spirit, a ghost, perhaps even worse. All was as usual: it was the same old story of the directors meeting in the middle of a meeting, then the old members, then the new ones, and now the original old ones, and now the second one. No wonder the prince felt very miserable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another part of the meeting hall there was to be found a very convenient vestibule, of large dimensions, and it was there that he happened to sit when and left his friends, but on the very other side of this vestibule there remained the room where, according to the prince's own fancy, the old committee meetings should take place. On the divan he sat, one elbow extended and the other half-turned, as though, as he was about to answer a very painful question. In the first chair he sat next to the old, fat, puffy minister, now\n",

      " pronounced by a small child’s voice on the night of March 8, 1943, at the end of the first train [it was one of those mysterious, rare and beautiful holidays, when a Russian holiday-maker, a schoolmate of the former czarist’s, visited London with a bambino and a boxful of cigars],” and a note of anguish and trepidation about its timing; but finally he received from a Jewish friend a translation of “The Adventures of Erwin Schröder” (Moser, The Adventures of Erwin Schröder [1953], and, in German, The Adventures of Erwin Schröder [1962], with the addition of \"A Russian Melancholia,\" a poem by Pushkin (1418–86).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moser’s wife died the day after his having written the little \"autobiography.\" Her friend, an old and talented dancer (and cousin of Erwin’s widow), was to have had a child out of wedlock in Berlin by a Jewish husband. The child was to belong to the class of “kiddie” (a word which is borrowed from “moy” as a simple Russian pun on “faun”). The girl’s father was to have been killed in a train accident on the Moscow Nevski Road.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later his wife was to have died in a fire, and the boy to have gone to school with her. It soon transpired that, in the course of the two-year separation, he had somehow acquired enough courage to meet and set terms with a girl who had at least the rudiments of an acquaintance with the school's best French and with a German “wife” (one of those small Hebrew females with small but large, pale breasts that you know only in one other place). He had been told by his chum, who himself would have looked like Kolin, that she was not available for his “work”—a euphemism for “conversation.” She had turned out to be a lovely blonde beauty and he had had her in his arms for a few minutes (her being on the whole rather short on human contact) when she was just that, a very light, very little, very pleasant thing. Now he had to be prepared to wait a little longer. To start with he had to inform his old teacher he was leaving—or, more exactly, should inform the school’s headteacher of “his intention to leave.” He should have a few more pangs than usual before leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now there were about a hundred people present. He was greeted by a woman with whom he had just had a talk. She asked him not to forget about the little Russian girl. He said that he would be delighted to, but at the time they’d better wait a while. An hour later he was informed that his absence was not a large matter with the lady. The rest of the meeting was an account of their conversation. It was decided that Erwin would be given a proper home while the boy’s father would be put to death. To this, Moser’s friend suggested that Mummy’s Diary should be used as the starting point of a new set of adventures, one that would carry on the life of the heroine until it was completely faded—say, after the publication of “The Adventures of Erwin Schröder” (the boy would probably die before completing it, in a few months, so that it was bound to be a best-seller or better, and it was too late for that).\n",

      "Her green-slipped, orange-shaded foot came under Jell-O’s heavy, crunchy slap, then a green paw which moved along the sidewalk, leaving a green shadow behind, and the same green paw emerging from the house, and the same green foot, the same foot—a kind of indelible, not yet quite visible mark on the skin. In her next moment, from my side window, I saw her walking with a green cane toward the sidewalk with her front paw pressed to her cane (which turned out to be a toy gun with a plastic cock—she was a toy girl), but the cane turned out to be the long cane with scalloped edges like those of a bumblebee, and with its black tips she made it bob across the asphalt, and the last screentest bit of the cane fell like a bird on the sidewalk, and with a gurgling exclamor she bent her cane like a kite and turned away, walking toward the house, and as she drew near she kept pressing the cane, a golden red ball, and I was afraid she might come out of the house and snatch it for her own, and by the second glance of my wife, I realized she was not, and by the third I saw her coming out of her house with the cane and running towards the house—no, still holding the cane, she ran faster, and presently she turned her head just ahead of the house, and with a sudden leap backward disappeared and ran up the sidewalk again to the park entrance, and upon reaching it I saw that she had turned around with the ball in her hand and turned her back to me, and that was not all: she had run out of the park along the sidewalk along the path between the trees, and that was the end, for she dashed back a full sprint—a running, swinging, slapping kick, a jock-kick, the ball on her shoulder—and I kept following the ball, my feet on the sidewalk, Jell-O’s voice behind me: “Run him to hell,” Jell-O, one side of the ball, the other side of the ball. That was all very fast, and I was laughing, but I soon realized that as soon as her green cane entered the tree line I would catch her and she would get into a tizzy, and suddenly I saw her run along the same ball and I realized it, and in that instant I felt something like an attack of the hands, and there was something in my brain screaming at me to rush for her, but I turned back, and as I turned I saw her lying on her stomach (I was trying to save her from Jell-O) and there was something in my hands telling me to take her by the elbow, which the very words “climb” and “fly” said aloud. Oh-so-carefree, how can I save her? She might see me, I might go crazy in my own arms, and all around I had to save her, but somehow I managed it, and within a couple of minutes they were leaving with her, and then came back the same day, and by the second, she was running along with the same cane, and she said to me, “Get in my arms, get me.” I said, “I got in your arms,” and she hugged me tightly, laughing as if her last joke were true, for I was lying half awake, and she was right where she had said—on second thought it was merely a matter of distance, for she had been running behind the ball for ages, and the ball flew past, the ball, the ball, and I felt a queer, dizzy breeze, and then my knees started to ache and my head was pounding, for I could no longer turn, and in the middle of the street she said with a smile, “Let’s go, you go!” and she ran away, saying, “I will be right back,” and then there was a long long, long wait, my ears ringing, my heart pounding, and that was not all: in the middle of the street she yelled out, “I can’t, I can’t, my dear, I won’t go, my dear,” and again the ball flew past again, and the ball again, and so on, and as she ran away I ran along with her, and the cane flew by like a bird, and then as I reached the park entrance I saw her running with the ball, and she said to me in a trembling voice, “Run him to hell,” and at that instant I realized that a few minutes ago I had gone insane—and here I stood, clutching the ball, and\n",

      "What, then, had she changed? Had she died? Or did our love for her mean, at one time, that he, the poet, the mystic—a word she could not remember anyway—had a similar feeling? “Oh, yes, indeed she did,” said Dr. S. to a very kind young woman, and as I watched in amazement and compassion the physician take his turn in the mirror, one can imagine what it meant to my sister and myself when his fingers, a long, dark, long life, began brushing the silky, glossy strand of his hair between the lashes, and there was a silky, glossy strand there too, and then all the eyes of a man in a hurry to pass the time lost the shade of his gaze too, and I can swear in the mirror that it was that same quick glance I saw when I met Dr. S. for the first time. It was a glance full of that old and horrible charm which, in the midst of such misery and anguish, had been in us all our lives, but now, at the very point we were in a desperate hurry to forget, and to resume what had been a dream of bliss … But when, instead of that happiness, I saw the face he made to that other poor fellow that night, I did not see the dead man I had been, and I know I shall never again say the word “I. did.!” That look of despair and despair with which he stared at me at night, when he was still in his coffin, I saw as an old painter sees when a certain subject is being tried once by a particular person and is successfully turned out of him, has now reappeared in his own likeness, is now in the guise of the man I had once seen and felt, only he is different, with another hair and different eyes.\n",

      "After having spent a few more nights in a sanatorium, Dr. S. was allowed to resume his own treatment and continued to dream more and more often. He was now taken by someone who knew he had contracted tuberculosis, but Dr. S., still in his bed, could not get used to that and was so afraid of making him repeat the dream and remembering it, so that he was obliged to take a stronger bedmate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning he would dream in a sense of relief: a sick woman is now able to walk about, it is a thing of beauty, she wears a white dress, she is healthy and beautiful, she speaks with a high voice, she dances a great deal, she is intelligent and kind. But the day after, when a very special guest came in, he heard what was thought to be his wife’s voice saying, ‘I cannot.’ But for some reason he dreamt that he had slept with the same woman in his dreams, and that she was still alive as long as his dream lasted. He was able to sleep, but not the whole dream and after a while he decided it mattered nothing. In his dreams his memory gradually faded away. It had already been made clear that this patient was in a rather bad way—he had made such a mess of a dream—and he even imagined the death that that nightmare must have been—and what was even more unpleasant was his having to perform that part of it in such a disarray. He had had the same illness that my sister had. The fever was much worse, he had a lot of pneumonia, and he was not only ill but very confused, and one night he had even dreamt of a little girl crying out, and when he woke up he was unable to remember what she looked like and said there was no possibility! His dreams appeared now and then to fade away, and when his nightmares got worse he would dream things were getting worse. There was a feeling of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what was left of his dream was not despair. It was an exquisite ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, when the day got really late, and I noticed that the doctor was not at home but was still walking down town, I realized that there was no point in waiting any longer: there was only one thing to do. I made a note of his telephone number and after a few days passed I sent him at one-thirty-nine. “I have just spoken with dear Miss Lik, who tells me that the gentleman has now gone away to Paris.” “It’s true,” I said to myself. “Of course this will please his friends.”\n",

If, however, you decide not to sell it to anybody, you can always ask me to remove it.

      "“The thing is still under construction,” he continued, and again the voice came. “But I will definitely deliver a speech here. One can, I expect, take, say, two or three hours, and we will probably spend the night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard a faint noise in the basement. He kicked open the door of his bathroom and, on top of the tumbled bed sheet, sat down on a chair, and immediately it started crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gustav came running in after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur Piffke,” said the voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down at a table and began to look around. The room seemed to be in a state of continual agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is where I believe you will get the most attention,” said Gustav, putting his hands in front of his shoulders. “If I could only put my stamp upon all this…”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe you will not only deliver a strong speech,” said Gustav softly, turning over so he could examine his friend’s expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course I’ll deliver a strong speech,” said Gustav, and suddenly he knew why he felt so buoyant as he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, no?” said Gustav, blinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gustav nodded and turned his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re the son of a minister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What kind of thing can be related to public opinion, I wonder?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped short.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re the son of a minister,” Gustav finally asked, lifting his head again. “I understand that you think I’m going to cause any offense. But, in any case, I’m going to deliver a strong speech. I have promised to devote all my energy to it. I know how unpopular I’m in my country. All of which, of course, is not true. My name is, as you know, Derechko—you’ll know it from the top of the stairs, if you walk down to the third floor,” Gustav said as he got up. “And I—oh, yes, I believe it. You’re right. But… but my name was already there.… Ah, yes.…”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gustav,” he said, leaning close to Gustav, “I believe I can’t go on with such nonsense.… All right, I’ll bring you your own room. I know you like hotels.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gustav smiled a radiant smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll come too. Don’t be late, dear.…”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down in a corner. From some hidden ledge he picked up Gustav’s small overcoat, his elbows resting on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sit down,” said Gustav.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m feeling very badly,” he said. “This is intolerable. How can I live if they don’t let me out of here? We’ll be married in Berlin soon, and the reception will be held there. I really feel terribly anxious. Do you, dear, promise to stay in touch?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise, I promise,” Gustav answered without giving his greetings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must not make her worry,” said Gustav softly, and then, turning and slowly sliding the door closed behind him, he left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that moment there came a rapid movement in the corridor. He glanced at her and saw that she was not in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, come on, let me go,” he said, pressing his hand firmly to his heart. “Something is happening. Come on, do something.…” But she was not there. The corridor vanished. He went to search, but found something much more surprising than he expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“… but she may have left me. I can’t—it’s not easy.…”\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran his hand up her soft throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, but… she may have left me—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was already choking again; he could not get down the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please, please. Tell me something to help me.…”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice was getting worse and his legs tingling. For some reason he felt that he could give Gusta the key, and, despite his fear, he took heart-shaped steps down to the corridor.\n",

She wore a blue mackintosh with a black shirt collar, a black blazer over a white blouse, a white skirt. I had a terrible feeling that she, at least, imagined you in a great part because that dress was so high and black and black. She was right; they do not like you. When I heard her knock at my door I felt as if the walls of my mind contained some dangerous, sticky powder. I remember the way her voice was agitated and her eyes bright; I was on the brink of losing my temper. Her face still looked wet. I sat down on the curb and looked about me.

But all of a sudden she would look at him with open astonishment and ask, “Why are you looking so at one moment?” “Why are you looking at me with such curiosity?” The words passed through her like rain. She did not bother to close her eyes. The soft crackle of her heart was as natural to her as the crackle of a spring thunderstorm. But somehow the question stuck in her memory and somehow the thought that maybe he had sensed something she might have known, in that instant before he had noticed her, seemed quite strange. She had been in his office after the meeting with Prof. Zilanov and had mentioned a couple of things to him. That she had had a very difficult time with her husband over the Russian mail. It had been quite something. He had said he was sure of it but she was convinced, so he should perhaps postpone the meeting, but first she must discuss things with him. “I was hoping,” she said, “that you would not be so late.

      "“No, no, I know everything,” she spoke in a thick voice, “I’m perfectly well, all three banks, up to this moment, but if you think anything of anything, I need an explanation.’ ‘If you’re not satisfied with everything,’ he repeated again in a lower tone. ‘If,’ she asked, he hadn’t told her everything, he wouldn’t be such a poor liar like that.’\n",

      "He had walked about two blocks. A half block after that. Finally stopped at the wardrobe where a fat little woman seemed to be in mourning. She wore a pale-colored frock with a wide sagging collar. Her hair was cut short.

In the upper darkness he could hear her giggling, clattering footsteps, rustling wallpaper, the sounds of the night’s breeze, and the soft clattering of a dress. A little further on, through the still dimly lit dressing room, a few people stood eyeing him from behind the curtains.\n",

      ", I was the only one to go with the general, which was even more surprising than the news itself. We were not alone, and I did not recall that I had gone to bed alone in a country house, with a stranger, to sleep, because I do not want to disturb him. The story is told, as we were going back to their rooms after we had taken care of his uncle on a bench the night before (or rather that afternoon or morning, depending on the transcription we do have of a word by the dead man) a beautiful stranger, in a nightshirt with a star on the collar and high collar-sleeves, the last of the village, came to him and, while I was already sleeping, he began to tell me. He told me what he would do in particular circumstances: he would be the first to go for one of those trifles, namely: “the well” is a phrase the country doctor has not yet found for. As you know, I do not know much about the well, but even so, the well was a very good one. And then, at the end of the report, the man—well, how is the word made to mean something, and by the by, how it begins to resemble a person, if, of course, there is a word with it. Well was I asleep. The two men who talked to me, after having discussed the job for at least five minutes, came in and they would never let me in again—they both had guns pointed at them—and even when they finally had turned out, in front of the general, that night, even that night the night seemed to be something very much like an afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the doctor, while he was talking to the night nurse, got himself together and began to explain more thoroughly and quite in a manner that was absolutely incomprehensible to me: “As we have already seen,” he was saying, “the well was, and always was, a very special very important, very old-fashioned one. I might have been the only one to know the special charm, but, well, it is all too obvious to say. I mean, if, by the way, the doctor had been the only one to know the special charm of the well, that would have been a curious situation. Now we are going in again; the night nurse is going to be quite gone now—well perhaps she is still in bed—the rest of the family is either out, is dead. Good God! I must have some more tea—we have to understand all this and put it all in one place and come back again all the people present, and all the parties, and this all must be put in order and this will lead to some sort of arrangement for the time being—and this—what does it mean, good God—to put it all in order?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We have now to be in bed quite as much as we did yesterday. The doctor had not quite finished; still he began to explain that in some cases a doctor’s heart can do more than merely a pump, he would have to have the other parts of the sick man—the breathing heart, for example, will have to become connected with the man in question, to the maximum use. But I thought we had gone to bed already, they were already coming down. No, we’m not leaving today, we shall remain in bed as long as you like. There is a very important piece of advice that we are reminded of every day in these moments or in any other moment, in any place or at any hour—it is quite useless to think that it exists at all—this is why we must remember that, if you have the same feeling, then they are already going home and to sleep, it is all a matter of simple, natural, simple sleep. We must sleep as much as this one will in order to feel our way down again. A simple formula may work, for I know I am an ordinary young man with a simple formula. We had not quite the time to be in bed. We had to be in bed by some hours after some of the very worst moments have occurred (if the situation is hopeless). I was still, you know, standing on the chair—I always knew in advance a person’s ultimate fate; now I knew the exact moment when he would die, I was sure that all was certain. He had not come home yet and I had just noticed that in the corridor he had gone (in order to talk to a girl). He did not come home—they came and he went, and then he went in a very different way—I will not go into detail of the scene here; if you want I can also explain more clearly that this was because he was waiting for the feeling of his new life. And what was not quite sure enough was (and no wonder—a man who never has known and will never find\n",

The only reason I felt at ease, the reason that might give me some security for coming at once (without interrupting them as my companions were urging me to do), was that I knew that my flight, and that I was ready to risk the rest of our journey.

He had, and when he thought that she was following me he stopped short and started after me. The first thing I did to try and make him stop was to try and touch me. He turned his head, touched my shoulder, and, speaking very softly, I made out in his soft black neck a slight tremble of welcome and a slow shuffle. He then turned sharply and, for that matter, entered my field of vision, was gone, and noiselessly there appeared before me what I had lost sight of one moment ago—a darkish car which turned in front of me, the black light of its turn became a greenish blaze and vanished.

      "I believe, as I do, that no human has ever lived for ever. I believe that any human has ever lived. I believe that my wife would like to live and work only her own existence, and the only thing we would have in common would be the dreamy dreams that she and I sleep in every day. I believe that my wife would like to be, and always be, alone in the world. I believe that we would be, and perhaps that we shall—and that my memory is a good one, and you, dear, will not have the time to write long sentences about my wife; I shall do so only when you tell me her first name, and then I am sure in my own case there are few things more difficult, if only because you would have been happier without the name myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to say something to you now and then. I know what your wife would think of an American president in the middle of his first term. It seems to me that you would probably not be able to hold him, and she will not care to know who that first president was. I shall even be frank—I may have come across a little nugget, too—if I ask you to tell me your wife’s opinion of a couple of candidates for governor of a state. Perhaps you will say that your wife will also be unhappy without a hint of good, rather than merely dead, news. I shall be honest too. I do not mind being told by your wife what she thinks of a husband. Let me, for example, tell you what she thinks of the possibility of a presidential bid. After all, it is the man who will be president and there is not much money to be made in politics, in my opinion. She will have to be told that the candidate she admires most is the one who has the best chance of doing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have told you how sad I am about our being unable to return to France. Let it go this way: if I did not write of it, my wife would not think of returning to France. In fact, I am sure she would tell you about the first president of France, when our country was not yet a nation, and even in ordinary times the French people did not know very many languages and so a great deal was not known to a French speaker. I must remember that there was no political danger in French or German and there was no danger in English either. I am sure the first president knew everything in German and was also an expert on people. It was then that I wanted to do the book of my life, which was not the hardest thing in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so sorry that my wife would be so unhappy if I were forced to leave Paris. My wish is certainly to see Italy, but I am not sure whether to go there alone or should not accompany her every day to a movie and then dinner in a big Italian restaurant called Lavoro. I would love to come over to my family in the near future.\n",

      "I am writing you now because I have the feeling we are both unhappy. I have no right to interfere in your affairs. I am a man of great indolence; there are things to do, and if you forget them, that is all, there is nothing to be done. Let it go with the thing, but if you want to get involved in my life or any of my books, please let me know. I have no illusions in my poor health. I have never read anything (I am very proud, you should know, what I have done) that I would not consider as a masterpiece or a masterpiece in my own lifetime. The more I am to you the more I realize that I am no writer and that there is no one else to create and read my life. But I could not imagine anything else. We are sure you are doing fine, my dear friend.\n",

I want you to go to California, to Hawaii, to places very far above my own shoulders. I want you to come to live with us at Balham, Massachusetts, in the year 1930, that is, before I turn seventy years old; and then I would like to be able to travel in the comfort of our own flat without your having to worry.\n",

      "“I’d be delighted,” said the Queen, smiling.\n",

      "“I could use the tea too,” murmured the man, and was about to give up trying to reason with the Queen; but she, smiling and shaking her head, said:\n",

      "\n",
      "“I see, so that’s true,” said the other half of his guest, nodding, smiling. “On the next day, when I was already in bed, my uncle gave me your card to read. It was a rather strange experience.… Yes. It was then that I caught you, the second night you came to dinner, the day after dinner, I had some business in hand, and suddenly, all at once, I knew that you were in our house. Of course, I was surprised. So that’s when you came in, my dear knight.” (“Oh, really!” thought the King.) “Did what you say really ring any bells for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "One felt, in order to be completely truthful, that he could have said the same thing to any girl he wanted. The whole story was rather strange. And then one day, on his way back from a stroll along the shady avenues, he stopped at a certain big-chested, fair-skinned, dark-haired young man standing with his back to the little black-robed gallery, as usual, near a dark red curtain, and there he stopped for a moment, listening with intense interest. The boy sat down beside him, turned up and sat down opposite; this arrangement seemed to the King a tacit contract between two rivals. The boy, with a look of quiet dignity, and the boy’s bare knee quivered—and simultaneously the boy’s lips moved and his teeth flashed with a gleam. The boy’s name was Ulyanov, and the boy’s father was a well-known poet. A solemn, somewhat embarrassed grin hung behind his puckered lips. The boy seemed to enjoy the attention which the King was receiving with his back turned to the other two competitors, whom he did not suspect but whom he felt very much attracted to one another with a kind of taciturn admiration. The King, with a smile of friendly disdain, was being led to his study by the same two young men, now firmly clad in their common flesh the features of a certain kind of competition. The King, a person of extraordinary erudition, could recall an enormous painting and a mere five paintings in all. A few seconds had passed since the moment the two young men had been seen standing there in the same pose, which had then been compared with the King, which now had been compared with the King of the past. The King now thought that the resemblance could not be accounted for by chance and was amused with a certain suspicion. He decided to tell the boy nothing of the sort. The boy was to be kept as much in the guard as possible, the boy would be given an allowance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King made a quick examination of his right sleeve, and while it was on the table near him, he heard distinctly the boy’s foot step on it and, with astonishment and delight, his eye followed the foot’s outline. No response? The King cleared his throat and made an inquiry. The boy had evidently been talking business over a cup of tea—the cup had come out fairly full. The King had the impression that those ripples on the table belonged to a hand; when he pushed the lid back on the table onto the tray, he heard a crack. The thin spoon had rolled its way across the table, and it seemed as if it were flying out into something, but now something was falling from it, and a sound came from underneath it. It sounded like a click as it was dragged along the floor and then a long while more, until the creak became more audible and came to a stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King consulted the small table near the door. No answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He closed the door and with the heel of his right hand, knocked twice without success. The sound, now less loud, turned out to be a soft 'click'.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the King waited for a couple of minutes. A little longer. Then he rang again. That made no difference. The answer came out the\n",

      " by to an old friend of mine. After that, in some distant house, there was an awful scene—howler monkeys, and a woman’s ghostly husband. These were the highlights of his recent life, and the one thing he knew for sure was that he would leave no testimony to himself—and thus lay not only open to detection, but was a known pariah to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would doze off after a hard-hitting lesson in the garden, then go to bed and read for an hour or so the newspapers or listen to Russian magazines, which he consumed at table. He was fond of reading German–based newspapers in bed, he believed that only Germans could be literate, and this impressed him as a kind of rare and precious privilege. He found many things interesting in English publications, and since the newspapers were either fake or made-up, he assumed that the authors had a complete contempt for literary life and the people. He read as a visitor to a hotel, and would go down for a drink in the bar. In Berlin “a lively and full-bodied night” meant good, but that did not necessarily imply that he was in the mood for drinking. The drink he had chosen was none other than the brandy he was to be sent to his room in a few days. On its way he passed a little inn in a row of houses. He would go in only after having spent over two hours chatting, trying to determine if every corner was a door of some kind; if no dice; if and if one had one hand and one eyebrow were gray and stiff, while the other and the eyebrows were aflame. In the bar and in the hall he greeted with his usual lightness and wit those to whom hospitality gave. His manner was always polite; his manner was always friendly; his manner was always the quiet one—and sometimes, as here, there was a trace of that special shyness which was characteristic to him: he would turn away without raising his voice as he sat in the middle of a table with two lumps of sugar (the former being the one you have just sucked), or, at a higher level, he would light a cigarette and, puffing, sip away; he would, moreover, keep his hands motionless as he sipped, and his nose would twitch in a silent sign of enjoyment. His habit of this quiet gesture is not one which the author noticed in other people during their periods of travel, and it was not observed in this person who was always sitting at table and making no gestures with his hands. He was good-looking in a moustach, fair-haired, pale, but not bald, and with broad shoulders and a large nose like that of an Arabian. His name was Ritter. He had come to stay two years before and had been always very sorry that he could not be of use to him, and he was now very glad to be leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down. The coffee was strong and hot. A plate of cappuccino was brought up. In his place a man with a little straw hat came dressed as the chef, and a waiter brought both drinks to the table. The barman poured one cup into the tea jug, the other—into his glass—turned and said: “If you like, you can have a bite or two of this apple.” His cup passed down the table and vanished into the minuscule vase of sugar that the small waiter was carrying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ritter was taken downstairs too. It was hot that afternoon, and in the damp and windy weather it was hard to breathe. At the door of that hotel room, however, he saw a slight light; then, it was whispered at the table by the waiter who came up to Ritter and asked him in what language he spoke German: “What’s the language?” “Pocht’—my Russian, isn’t it?” “In any case it’s very old-fashioned, Russian, and it’s so annoying,” added the waiter. “Can’t you get on?” was the question which was whispered back, as a reply: “Please, we’ll wait for you upstairs, a few seconds, I don’t have much time,” said the waiter. “But why, when the weather is good? It never rains, but rain does happen.” “When?” asked the waiter. “Right now it’s a bit early for the weather’s good. Well, well, good-by” said the waiter, leaving. “No, no,” said the small waiter, and went out.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have been in this house now for a month when suddenly, to fulfil a ridiculous wish, I left the room. As I was walking along the corridor (with the help of a magic wand), I caught sight of a man, of a kind of bulky shape, who was sitting at a table under a bed. He turned round and proceeded to stroke me gently, for which, I felt, I was thankful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon returning to the room, I noticed that my old friend, now dressed in his new uniform, in a dark-brown suit with the same red collar as he had worn that afternoon and evening, had gone and stood in the corridor. I followed his gaze, and he, a slight old man with a round forehead and a red heart-shaped puckered mouth, slowly turned his head and looked at me. Then he walked at the door slowly, as if he were not in the room, as if he wanted to make a telephone call. I looked up. He sat down on the bed and closed his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did you come to town?” I asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave a start and looked up again.\n",

      "“The whole point of it,” he said. “That's your purpose. That’s why.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“You see, my dear, I had wanted to make a difference; I wanted to help, to do something. But the thing got hopelessly mixed up with my family; and now I’m afraid to be seen as too much of a meddler in your business affairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him some more about his old friend, and he seemed surprised when I told him that I had only recently met him and had fondly greeted him as I knew my old schoolmate would be the best friend he could have on earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was about to leave, I spoke to him quickly and thoroughly and he returned and walked beside me back toward the hotel. “Do you know,” I said, “I have only just now begun to ask you for a secret plan of operation. But the way was wide open, and any time now I can just get in touch with you …” and all this was done in such a quiet, orderly and precise manner that I almost forgot how to swear, lest I should start to talk all kinds of things of my own, which I should very much rather not have heard. So I kissed his hand and started to pace the hall. I know he would look up at me, in case I should come after the time of sunset and go out; and so I paced, and I walked on in silence, and then suddenly, in a roar of haste, I uttered a cry, as if some dreadful catastrophe came tearing upon me—and on I ran to the room where I had left that little white-capped friend—and the rest of my journey was all but a jumble of scattered thoughts, I didn’t know where to look, not to what lines to cross, and I did find myself in a horrible predicament since I could not think up an itinerary for my journey back to him. I wanted to leave him and go back to my husband who was in England, with the exception of my luggage, and then do my best to reach that destination as soon as possible. For, as soon as I arrived on earth, I was in all probability to return to the house of a friend of my father, who would not let me out of his life. In those days, all those in charge of our affairs were men of the world. In the first place, they kept on holding my luggage, while the car I kept driving was already unharmed by the engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What must I do with you?”—I asked myself—“do whatever I want to do with the wretched man, but the sooner I do it, the better.” If I were a more self-assertive person, and if I had the capacity of actually carrying out a plot, and if I were not on the alert, what I would do if, say, a certain old man was in the city, plotting some great crime, I would at once take those simple steps which no other would follow: I would call him up,\n",

      " I?” queried Kostya, his blue eyes bright, his cheeks plump and flushed, as he stood on the little balcony.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ach!” said Kostya in a low voice and the little balcony in the sky parted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kostya was a skinny, shortish, stocky man, and very clean-shaven, although I’d put more vigor into my pince-nez—not so much because of his lack of pince-nez but because of the other little conveniences—a little linen bag, a newspaper, a shaving kit, whatever you like to put on a man. He sat leaning against a metal railing on the terrace of a luxurious hotel, his right foot extended, the black leather of his shabby slippers falling on the grass and then scattering about him like flocks of mustard. His bald pate and mustache gleamed in the sun. He had spent some time in the Imperial City. His face, all glistened, was sooty and the wrinkles of the nose soothed and warmed his eyes that he seemed not only to see but to hear himself saying those little things about himself. I had asked him some fine, curious questions—such as what city he had dived in—and when he had finished, had I seen the hotel, and heard the hotel, he had simply nodded; and in general, every time I had asked such simple questions, he had merely nodded in a bored way that I could not help noticing something amiss or wrong in him. No, he was not dull. I thought he was getting his education. He could recite with perfect clarity Euclid, and to prove it he would have to invent some formula entirely new and astonishing, as if Euclid itself were the invention of an author. He was a poet! He wrote poetry! His penmanship and the style of his verse reminded me of that of the great men and of his own. The only peculiarity I found in him concerned his peculiar style of looking at things, an important one which seemed to me almost an invented thing; this style consisted, first, of a concentration of the mental action of the will upon a picture, so to speak, of the will itself, and even of a mixture of that picture’s action and that of its will; and, secondly, of the simultaneous expression of the mental action of the other; for instance, I saw the image of his house (the house in which I live) reflected there in his eyes; and the image of mine, if taken together with the images in the house, would produce the idea of a certain combination or arrangement. The idea is the will to do what is right. The formula is the result, the result is our individual personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that the general idea is well expressed. He saw his house, in the white exterior of which his window, half-closed, was leaning, and saw that I was sitting there in the drawing room, on all white chairs. This is quite a simple concept—but the construction is quite absurd. You must have known it by now if you have ever seen my face. My drawing-room is just as empty as the drawing room itself. Let me put it more precisely: there are two views toward the house—one through the front door, and a view through the back. The front view (the front door) is a mirror reflecting the reflected image. The back view (where the view of the flat is concealed) is merely a reflection, reflected to itself, of the reflected image; that is, the reflections are not at all alike. In a certain drawing room there are the tables, and on those there was once a carved pine, and the table was once a molar, and on those there may be a rose, and a little thing like this, a piece of jade, as you remember. It does not matter much to me.\n",

      "Here I am trying to clarify something on Pnin’s part—I was not entirely clear what he meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "By no means is Pnin completely opposed to the idea of evolution within the limits of reason. I might as well bring him into direct play in view of certain observations on his part. As I remarked in a previous note, Pnin thinks for his time. In this connection Pnin is of the opinion that the mere fact of a thing’s going on does not prove that it has not started: it is true of every living thing which has not started, and it is also true of evolution. And, as I have already noticed, he does not, although there are those who find it remarkable that so long a phenomenon which was only now being lived (see note to line 648) should have, when considering itself, become a living thing, come out as living. And, finally, I must not forget that this same Pnin, who was the chief expert on embryology till\n",

He felt a bit better today; that is, he was very glad to see the way his day went.

      " belly of a chair; another, a table, some sort of shelf, a chair of the same type. Now here is a chair of the same type but with a little more storage space; this chair will be of an ideal standard—no hinges, no hinges at all—it is not suitable for use in conjunction with the back of the head. Next is a chair with a foot resting on a foot; and here there is a chair of the same type but with the other foot extended. And another. This is the type of one I would like to use with you myself. The third is a chair with a foot that is not a leg but is a chair with the other foot extended. The fourth is something very like the fifth but with a foot not a leg. And there is one more. I do not know if you like it, but let me suggest that if you want, you may place it on the edge of the chair and arrange it so that the half is horizontal, the half is vertical, then place it there and leave the remainder as is or leave it like this, but with your sole leg extending, that is, if you like and without the chair protruding any more; and do not leave the body part on the seat—that would be silly.\n",
      "\n",
      "When in the next period one becomes proficient with these types of simple chairs one notices that they are not the sort that can be easily and quickly assembled. In most cases they are much too unwieldy and unwieldy. I cannot show you a picture, but here is a model of one with the head supported by some kind of cord. I have drawn it to form a triangle. Please take time to place it in space and you will quickly see its place in the picture. It is not meant to be a stand-alone model but rather to be used as a foundation where one can easily move on to more ornamental subjects. As well, the back of the chair should be not quite as flat as the surface of the table. But if you want there is a simple way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a model of its kind for the back of the chair. You are free to place it in any way you wish. I may leave it there; it is just a reminder. Now if you want it to be in that orientation it should not be in the middle—that is the way things are done in my book. I would like it to be in the center and in that position with the chair at the end of its frame as shown above. This is not easy if the armature is not quite vertical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if you want it vertical, you must first make sure that the head is not hanging upside down on the cord, and in that position the back should not be exactly horizontal, but if you can manage it, it should look like the picture. Now, if you want the back to look like the one shown above, you'll have to add in place the curved support of the cord and the three or four cubical areas shown by the dotted lines and then you shall have your chair in order.\n",

With his left arm he was shaking a black-breasted old man in a blue frock, who was sitting at the same gate and staring at me with a wide smile. “Well, I’m here,” I said. The taxi driver, meanwhile, was giving me his hat of his own accord and turning the corner. I was already far ahead, and just needed to turn as sharply as I had just walked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now light outside the window. The road, by the shape of a carousel, curved into the sky, and then crossed over to the left. The old man in the frock, standing by the mailbox, kept turning at the same instant I was coming along the road beside him, and the sky seemed to follow me. I got out, glanced up, saw the taxi approaching and turning in that direction, and then, still looking for my keys, was driving with full conviction, banging gently on the windows. In the cab I heard a woman’s soft voice saying something, but the car was not turning: a shudder of wheels had started up inside the cab, and as I was turning, the old man in green mackintosh lifted his head and said: “I don’t know who that is, but that’s a fool, you must never show your face to people, you have ruined my life. And I have told my wife, and I shall tell you to stay here, and I shall tell you to get out, or I shall die of the inside and come here, I shall never forgive you.…” I said nothing, but felt sorry enough to drive home and to send Martin a telegram that night: Happy New Year, little miss. You must have suffered a small stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began to talk about school and about death. Martin stopped and asked me if I had been a very bad pupil. I answered that I had been a very bad pupil, and had improved a lot since the day of my duel with the Chekhovs. “You will be very disappointed,” she said. So she drove me to the station and we sat on both sides of the car; I said I would wait a bit. Then we drove around for a while, and she looked at the trees on the other side of the track, at the low sunflowers, and said: It must be dreadful to see a train in that sort of weather. When we got there, I kissed their hands and said how glad I was that they had let me out, and the man gave me his gold watch.\n",

      "He had, I knew, heard before, while a child on the other side of the frontier, in the heart of that state, was talking of the things which had terrified him before I died. If I had died, and if I came to like Martin, here I would have said, I would never have allowed myself to have written “naked” or “wild,” as happened so often in the past, and never had I thought of them as “wild creatures” as some people did. There is, for instance, the gentleman with the green mustache in my group who said to me once: “What’s he up to now?” I replied, and added that I knew Martin’s place was not at the back as it sometimes was, where young people go to watch cars or what have Youde with their parents. And yet I had always loved the place, and now, now, when everything was so clearly written, and no more in the way of terror came the closer I came to Martin, I felt that such a love existed in me which a blind man could hardly imagine. And to this I replied that I was happy to live in that kind of remote cabin, with the woodpile of a fireplace in the nursery, the bed in the nursery, the stove and those other things, and that there was nothing to my liking there. I thought of those fond old times when Martin and I would go out on the river, the water in the brook, the beautiful and dark of the house and of the distant blue of the house yard when you heard music coming from the stairs.\n",

I did my best to put into place what happened in my draft: it was quite clear that the Russian text was being completed (or more precisely, I felt certain that the translator of this Russian text already under way would not disappoint) when I received those two pages.

But on the other hand, as you see, I shall do my best not to interrupt the flow of time; and if, as presently appears, I forget about it, it will not be a loss—since I shall keep the correspondence for a few days anyway.

      "I was not born in Europe but grew up in Germany. My father, who spoke German fluently but not the language himself, moved from house to house, meeting people and trying to sort things out in the most complicated of ways. After German and French came his mother's family which had been brought over in the thirties from Russia when they had a house at the same time as his own, and there, too, my father behaved a little erratically—not forgetting his papers, which was a regular occurrence (old people forget their hats quite as often as they forget their shoes). The house was still there when I was still there, and all traces of it are now almost obliterated by time, such as a little stack of books near the pool on the right-hand side of the stairs that I recall climbing upon my grandfather’s bed to read or the top-shelf in my father’s lap, filled with books about which he had not been alive when reading—not counting his own reflections in the glass of the dining-room on which, in the days of his youth, he played tennis under the patronage of his friend and friend’s brother.\n",

      "“I believe in you!” shouted Kostya at Maximilian and he jumped to his feet in a blaze of clap-clap-clap. Kostya was a very good athlete. His eyes were large and broad, and the expression of his face was filled with energy. He wore spectacles. He wore a brown dressing gown with pleats at the neck, a white shirt with a frilled cicada collar, black boots with high collar and high suspenders (they were long in winter, but even the lachrymatory note of the rain soon wore off, and had to be continued from a further level).\n",
      "\n",
      "Maximilian said nothing. He had a strange feeling he wanted to go but didn’t want to come near the place. He was on his right, between the pines on the slope which slushily rose before descending into clouds as they did down here among the dandelions —\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, you big bird,” said Kostya with a slight yawn. “Just a short run, we’ll go on, we’ll go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both men, being both tired, were now beginning to get restless. Maximilian, for whom the whole game was really about to be concluded, decided that it would be rather unpleasant. He went down to the river now. The wind was going as hard now as it had been in the beginning. In the forest, the sounds of distant music were now as distinctly audible as in the past. But what pleasure did the pines give him? He looked at them and tried to imagine how his companion was looking. His eyes would close after a while, and then he would relax again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found himself on the bank of a river, at a spot about two hundred feet above the level of a waterfall, between the branches of an old maple tree, and as he looked farther, he distinguished a rustle and motion of sorts. But this had only been seen once before. At home, Maximilian had often thought how very quickly everything would fall apart, how little had he really wanted to live this way or that, had he seen the light? He looked again, and it was just as difficult for him, both because of his inability to imagine, and because he was not sure whether to go down now or stay at home and find out whether it had been seen before. He decided to go down and went down. From a higher or lower bank, or even from a precipitous cliff, he could see the river in front of him, and the white, black, yellow-brown leaves of the maple tree. Then there was, in the distance, the streambank, with a rustling, sash running, blue and red-dark, and a brown man was sitting under a thistle — a man he had not seen in a long time, and in that sash there hung a white flower. The river flowed smoothly into the sky, while the riverbank was smoothed out, and a sparrow, which happened to be standing under the thistle, was carried up with great, jagged haste by another man, and then both swimmers and their poodled brides were carried away by Maximilian. Kostroma walked backward, then forward. He tried to think of something to do, but that was all. When they had gone he turned and walked on, and kept looking up. A few paces from where the river ran, he saw a narrow path, parallel to the river and encircled by a cluster of white butterflies, which seemed to resemble white, or at least to appear to resemble, the leaves of a maple tree. From there it was on down to the river. Behind the trees, in the sky, there was a gap, a gap which Maximilian alone knew. Beyond that gap stretched a gap of sky and sky, both indistinct. And in that gap there ran a gap of wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must cross on right foot,” said Kostroma and began to walk, and as they walked, their shadows fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were close to the forest when another, far, music stopped as they passed below a pine precipice and there was a burst of applause — at least it was a loud, clear, audible applause. The trees swayed and were soon silent. The crowd gathered around them had grown, and there was a tumult now. Some of the people had something on their faces, and, in this crowd, some were shouting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to write to the hotel at a hotel down there,” said Kostya, and the music again ceased.\n",

All of a sudden she turned her head in that precise and loving mirror, looked around—and there was a bright, strange land, a beautiful forest and the golden glow of early sunsets. The wind in town was as sweet and warm as if she were living in Germany, when she should have been living somewhere like this.

You are so silly!” he shouted—again—and the pain in his chest was suddenly unbearable. “You must never, never, never give that old man such a fright, don’t you, don’t you,” as it were, let him look at you with that nasty expression of yours.\n",

      "Suddenly, without warning, in his vast roomy room, as he opened the heavy shutters, there came a burst of voices, loud and shrill. “You’re not going to die,” said one voice as it passed him by and rose again. “Your name.” “My name is Gruzinov. I’m a journalist, an old man, but still strong and strong.” “Gruzinov,” said another, approaching him, “I see you’re still alive.” “I hope so,” muttered Gruzinov, and suddenly the nightmare began to make him uncomfortable.\n",

      "He remembered the little wooden figure, the little shadow, the long, brown, glossy neck, the shiny, wet hair… He recalled how he used to go in and sit at his desk—a thick, comfortable, plush leathern sofa—and suddenly hear the voices. He recalled their clamorous, muffled sound, and then the distant sounds of the garden below.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remembered the voices, the sounds of the voices continued to rise, but now they were higher, louder—and, like a crowd of roaring horses, kept speeding along, with a scraping and scraping, the window shutters and their rustling, their rumbling, their grinding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt strangely relaxed, and relaxed even more so were those voices for a long while were mingling with the nightingales in the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were coming nearer and nearer, the voices that he would always hear coming from his room now blended with the voices coming from all over the house—at least into the morning.… And he recalled again that all around in his dreams some mysterious entity was going on, that he knew nothing of what, why and how it had happened, although he knew that it was morning and that he had to go outside.…\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the night was as soft as a bed; he heard the sound of the motor’s exhaust approaching; he saw on the pavement a red car, the back windows of which were gliding, their light sparkling, and a lady’s arm, outstretched—his arm, outstretched, in fact, because she was sitting among the horses. They were traveling north in a greenish shadow, turning more and more rapidly, one could see the little house, the little green barn, the big, warm-skinned old man, the dark, droopy, droopy eyes, those white, bloodless ears, the round nose; it was as if he were being led by a ghost, and the horses were running in a great, fast, jagged storm, as they tore away from the house, and the sound of the motor’s exhaust approached, maddened by the night and a fear of heights, but fortunately not injured, with that terrifying, rumbling, scraping roar, and the driver’s eyes became transparent—for indeed, there was a person at the wheel: Kolin, the driver. He saw the front windows of the car suddenly split and fly out of control, and the car burst into flames with a plop—but then a flash of light, a rush of air, then a crash, then an avalanche of smoke.\n",

When he had dressed, Baum slipped into the corridor and, before shutting the door with the latch, started to inspect the various rooms. The hall was large, but very quiet, and he found a warm place to hide. The black-beaked woodwork on the ceiling was all peeking over the peeling tiles. He had a black blanket and two pairs of clothes and a bed. It’s nice to think, he thought. He would sleep in this room until day was over and then go out to find what he had been keeping secret. Then, he added, he would go out to meet that beau in black. In order to amuse the poor fellow, Baum set off into the darkness by means of a small, very elastic, rubber band. At first the door’s back was slightly ajar, and he had to coax the knobs in order to free the little wooden chest.\n",

Baum quickly unlocked the outer door and went out, and again there was a sound of pounding boots as he pushed and pushed, hoping that he would be victorious.\n",

She used her hands to wipe the flies from my face. She picked at the flies with her little tongue. In the mirror I saw her half-surfaced, wearing a green kerchief, her large thin lips half-open and a hazy expression on her beautiful sunken eyes which seemed to be glued to the roof of one of the windowsills.\n",

Its thin hind legs, its coarse tail tucked under its head and between its rook’s claws, resembled those of a horse. The poor animal was so uncomfortable in its hideous condition that I stopped to think how far it would stretch and how long it would last, and how long I would be able to hold it, and try to find some use for it, and what it would make with it, and how my wife would get up and go. At the same time I was terrified and yearned for some immediate relief. I pulled the little top flap of my shirt off and with my teeth I began examining the inside of the top flap. And all at once it all went dark inside me, the torment became unbearable, and I plunged into a cold sweat, for I kept groping for something, anywhere, for there was nothing, and it began to snow, and I realized that it was not my coat but her coat that I was staring at. Her face, her hair, the snow and fur were melting and falling in the windows of my horror. I realized that it was not she but her snow-cappuccino, and I found it so difficult to breathe, I started counting the steps she would have to take out of the snow and hurry off, and I wondered if the room was still warm, since I felt myself freezing more and more from cold, to the very edge of her warmth.…\n",

I thought it over and then I opened the door and as I looked down I saw my wife standing under the bright, brilliant bed.\n",

I used to go riding with my mother here, a skier and a bike messenger, who called me Thunderbird—the nickname he had applied to his school at school. A beautiful, healthy adult, as I had always said, I was always delighted to see a fat boy with a fat girlish face—I had an easier time falling in with the girls when I could glide in with a simple swing. Thunderbirds were called by some spangles or with glistening eyes; little ones used one of those glittering nets. And I used to love to make love in the sunlight. A warm wet air had an exotic charm, the trees were my favorite and most varied, and, of course, I had to climb on the summits and rocks—and there in the mist there\n",

But on the evening of July 15, the day before he was due, the director had suddenly demanded one month more—which, of course, was not taken into account in Valentinov’s performance.

He had a keen mind and a keen passion for the truth, for the simple things in life, for the way things should be—that sort of thing. This love for the simple and wholesome was expressed in his writings: in the first he would always begin: “The life I lead has a simplicity to it”; and his view of this or that particular mode of life was usually based on this or that single, simple concept. Thus, for example, life, happiness, the world, are all but sounds: they only signify bodies, but this whole consists of body parts and the motions of bodies, and it is only bodies that indicate this simple, simple life. “Or take this very simple, very flat little fact: the body is not a living thing, it does not live but takes sound in order to live, and the life that includes the sound it leads to a living conclusion, which is a certainty to a certain extent but not a certainty.”\n",

All his other writings always ended in a certain way—either by showing its absurdity, or at the same time, by proving how absolutely free we are from all such doubts as do not exist in reality itself. This did not please his fellow writers—who in general had not much to say to him. “And yet”—said Valentinov’s friend, the science journalist Pavlov Smir, “to enjoy one’s freedom is wonderful.…” He was right.\n",

He lay awake, imagining the pink blanket stretched across the next to its wall. He started to look through the gap: the blanket was stretched out sideways against the wall. To make the gap bigger he had to add a little more wool. He had to do it all over again: add layers of wool, knit it tighter. To make it into a snug circle, he needed woolen thread; so he bought woolen thread on the spot.\n",

      "For all its technical brilliance he remains unable to form a coherent picture of his own being, of his life in general, and of this particular life. It is as if there is a part of him that knows his presence is somehow related to his own, but he conceals from himself the power and responsibility he feels toward it. It is even more than once happened to an elderly gentleman who has lost a leg and is walking along a street, but feels somehow ashamed to bring up his own family and sees himself as a stranger; similarly, some poet has lost his way among an indescribable number of books, and suddenly realizes he is a poet of genius, but knows it is not just any poet but a single solitary one, and the glory of his discovery is completely eclipsed by the shame, the terror, the distaste toward people of genius.

That same solitude which makes one sad causes us to forget the world around us: for that part of the soul that is concerned with creative tasks, such as composing verse or prose, it is in general difficult to forget the world of others. There are all sorts of trivial complaints that come to the mind when considering my situation. All the time I have been writing my verse it is in this or that province, an unknown land, that cannot be familiar territory, inhabited only by lechers and zoos, that is, by people who would break up the rhythm with a “nodder” rhyme and a “wetter” line. To sit on a train and think about poems is to sit on one’s uncle’s lap. In the middle of the night I would get so bored with the thought that I would start to write at a dream pace, keeping up with the train. I imagine the quiet of a house in the dark: no one came home after dinner. There must be some one in bed. In bed I would be alone: nobody could hear me. Then again, in the middle of the night, an old man in the forest would come running to his voice from the valley into the open garden, to give an explanation, and the whole world would go shivering, and then for a long time I would not be able to sleep nor would I be able to sleep. And all the while I was still repeating slowly and softly over my mouth the words of a verse that had not been written yet, and everything inside me was brimming with a strange light.\n",

I would try to get a word in with them, and here I was ashamed to make myself known: did I meet one who asked if I wanted to go to a party and find out if there would be another guest? Did I see somebody already in the neighborhood? The fact that somebody talked to me did not matter, since in the state I was in I was not in contact with anyone — I just had to get past him, and everything would be all right, I would say. I did not look round, I was afraid, nor did I open my mouth; a spasmodic contraction of flesh, and a sudden feeling of suffocation; it had already been four hours already that day; and if I did not find some solution to this unpleasant problem I doubted whether I would ever be able to sleep and whether I would leave the room. But I did not want to go. I wanted to have lunch and leave later. And, perhaps in the evenings, I would see others again: for instance, there were all sorts of people here that I never knew, such as: a Russian immigrant, a German scientist, a Frenchman with a peculiar way of dressing, a German who had come all the way from a very distant place, and a certain fellow student whose name I had heard in the music halls that I knew well long ago. I was so uncomfortable that the only way I could get going was by using two or three different routes — the main one being to get out of my room and go to the library, then returning; the second being to meet some people, and the second being to get into the house. I did not know what direction to take, which way to go — and if I looked round, where was I? That was a mystery.\n",

It is difficult for me to speak of my books, so that this must be understood as a limitation and not a sign of their ultimate condition. If, however, it is the case that I was prepared to keep the book unfinished, why, because I was, and because readers have been shown nothing but the beginning of the picture, according to my theory?

      "ov was the second person in the room, sitting with feet slightly apart. He was a man of fifty, wearing elegant, white-buttoned suit, and was doing most of his talking during the first person, then shifting back into the seated position during the second. In recent years he had lost weight and now looked rather plumper, if one discounted the wrinkles on his forehead. The way he bent over the table, touching his lips with a rapid glance of serious provocation, meant that he knew exactly why he had become so fat. He had not seen his face much since his first thirties, and that had been in Russia, where, he told himself with grave deliberation, he would learn to live in a different country. It was a country where art, literature, wine and, let us not forget, war had merged. There, in the green shrubbery between his home and the nearest village, he had been living since his twenties, working as a horseman, but every day now it seemed as though he was running short of cash, so much so that he would get up hastily dressed as a foreigner's coat; he would go out as early as possible, walking a short while each way in an attempt to reach the nearest village.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fat village shepherd who lived on the other side of the road had a daughter of five or six and a nymphet of eight or so, but he had lived in the city all his life, having been born in the city. So, when he heard of Luzhin's death on the road, he came to him as if to say, look at me, I know all about it, I saw him at the station on duty—but Luzhin said nothing, he looked straight in front of him with a tense expression and then shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s there? A man?” inquired the shepherd uncertainly, turning to the dark-browed young dark-eyed farmer who stood with an umbrella. He kept stroking the young bird with his own hands, and the young dark-eyed woman spread her arms, as if extending a warm hand. They both laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, how’s your cousin?” asked the shepherd.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s in the kitchen,” said the dark-eyed woman, taking off her gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "They both laughed harder. She lowered her fur collar and, laughing, bent her head forward, away from the heavy ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d like to go for a walk,” said the dark-eyed man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We won’t have him out for tea today,” the shepherd said in a thin, deep voice and, stroking her cheek, looked up. 'You shouldn’t have come, you’ll end up with a cold.” He lowered his head a little. Luzhin laughed. The old man shook his head, then stroked his beard with the fingers of his left hand. Suddenly he glanced at the sky—it was dark again. The old man let a black shadow slip away from him, with a deep sense of melancholy, on the little table and smiled at his wife. Luzhin, having finished his coffee, took a napkin out of his hand and smiled in silence. The sun slowly turned the corner of the greenhouse. A tiny dark cloud appeared over the village and then, with a swift rustling, flew out, leaving an enormous fiery sun on the hill above the lake, on the bridge over it, on the house beyond it, and on the table at table. He cleared his throat, smiled, and started to his feet, already shuffling toward the village. 'You’ve no need to hurry,” he said, “the road is quite easy and I’m sure you’ll be able to see me home from here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shepherd looked at the empty space, then turned back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s enough, you must go,” he murmured. 'Today—No, no, it’s only a spasm.…”\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time in his life Luzhin felt bored. He got into his overcoat and went out for a stroll. He went very fast, kept telling himself that tomorrow he would be tired, but there was something about his walk through this part of Russia that compelled him to accelerate his steps. Only the day before yesterday he had thought to make a certain report to his employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yesterday,” he said when he saw the director, “I asked him if he wished to see me personally. He said yes—did he not? I asked for a meeting immediately—and he said it would be impossible for him to refuse; nevertheless he sent me letters, and I am simply unable to understand why they need\n",

He read over the letter with fresh, cheerful, rather than alarm, attention, carefully recollected the fine qualities of the English language, such as the way the letter, as in Russian, crossed the word “again,” and recalled that Zina had once told him about a film which she had seen called “Légitine” (“Le Fou as les yeux”)—“the same sort of thing, just a little longer.” And presently he received a letter from the producer congratulating Valentinov on reaching the twelfth of July.\n",

      "“It’s still half an hour before we are due,” said Martha—and she got up from the table again, and sat down again with bowed head on it on her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come on, let’s go, don’t be shy. A woman’s charm is her own beauty, her own charm,” said Franz, flaunting the flabby, white-shod limbs of his fiancée.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun played with the sides of the sky and the edges of the beach askew. The sea rushed past, as if a screen of silver were continuously growing in its depths. Franz sat on the edge of the beach, while his fiancée made a droll report on how many sunburnt feet of sand there were near the spot where a young man, half-discovered, now known to her, was resting. She was right. If one looked carefully, one could distinguish, as clearly as if one looked through a veil, Martha’s bare, naked, long-fingered hand at the base of his sand-clad skull, and his fingers and thumb, which the sun had touched in the middle, shone also. And then, with a blissful feeling, she took the plunge while he tried to regain his composure. His knuckles were like blackened poker chips, and his eyes like obsidian.\n",

      "“Good Lord,” she said, “what a terrible accident. He can breathe life into that little rubber boat. No doubt it’s some kind of gas leak.”\n",

      "“Water under pressure,” she repeated.\n",

      "“And then I could do a lot more,” he agreed reluctantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt disgusted, not only with his rashness but with the whole state of being in life: the dead man with his dog on a strap, the sailor with his mazy boat, the mountain climber who has to wear long underwear, the couple enjoying each other after a day of strenuous bargaining, the mountain climber and his wife, the mountain-climber and his wife—all this together in one comprehensible package, and now, as soon as he had thought up that accident, his life spun out of control. From the air made of wet gravel one could see an expansive, green field, with tall grasses growing higher and higher up, and when one began to ascend the slope one was sure, without looking, to find a slope with a mountain. A gust of humid air came in contact with Franz and a hot black wind blew, with a patter of wood chips, across the white asphalt. The sun, already bathed in yellow light, was already setting its canvas on fire. He could stand it no longer. He had reached the top of the slope. The sun, already extinguished, was passing through the roof of a hut, while in the shed beyond, in a cubicle, beside the fire, Franz sat, barefoot, in an armchair. In the bright void beyond, behind a black tree, stood the sound of clapham mauve, with a birdlike face and wings. He thought: Tomorrow I am going to see you again, that woman has come running towards him, but it’s only a matter of time before she runs into trouble. But he was mistaken. She will run into trouble without knowing about his death. And since, indeed, he had only to tell her about his dead son. A sudden panic overcame him. He thought: Please, don’t panic. Let her know how happy you and my death made me. Yes. Her mind will know how to cope. Tomorrow I’m going to tell her. So he continued on his way out. He walked with a heavy step, looking about him not just for places to pass by but also for people to meet him. Sometimes there would be a little crowd of people pushing their way through a portal into a more or less dim, shadowy place, and when he reached a certain point on the slope, he would have to do a hasty U-turn, then a very slight U-turn, then a very slight U-turn, and so on over again. And by the way, if he could only get rid of that whole crowd of things—the stone steps, the red brick, that frightful pile, which he saw so plainly in day that he could make out the outlines of people and objects by the brightness of their shadows on the level ground, and here he was forced to halt, and the red brick, which he saw so brightly with his own eyes but was unable to bring out with any firmness of perception. Meanwhile he kept slipping down the incline through the same tunnels as the rest of the\n",

      " evening for more than three hours’ talks with the editor of a German-language weekly. The room was dirty and cold; a square hole in the wall prevented one from walking up the corridor, and a rusty lamp next to the bed was in need of a round-trip adapter; a pair of ordinary shoes stood in a corner; and there came an excruciating tinkle from her bed below. She was in the middle of an article, one of her articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "She came in with a smile, and immediately sat down on a chair and began taking off her galoshes. The old girl’s gray-silk-clad feet were bare, and her shoulders showed pink as if she had been ill. Her neck was light and clean; they had a touch of pinkish silk. Her ears were covered with a very fine little molehilic thread. As she was leaving the room the pencil extended from the drawer, slowly crossed its lazy line, and then, with a small crackle, slid back across the silk. An instant later, however, that same pencil extended its entire length and, straightening up, took a long time to straighten up again. The thread was now snipped and thrown aside. “Ouch!” the old girl said with a cough. “Ouch! Ouch! Very nice, very nice. What was it you wanted to find? What was it—an album, a novel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She produced from the breast pocket of her raincoat a small volume she had kept as a souvenir during her American tour. A little of it was crammed with her school cap and gray flannel overcoat, a fair deal of its contained phrases not found in her schoolbooks. Her index card, in pencil, displayed her smiling broadly: “Catch,” “Catch,” “Catch,” “Catch,” “Catch” and “Catch,” and on the last page “Catch” in gilt letters. She gave the little volume to Rakey and said: “Well, as you know, I can’t write any checks.” “I’ll look up a few.” Rakey went on with his list, picking up and clinking several envelopes: “I’m leaving for England;” “I’m coming to America; or where?”—this was a repeated allusion to the “Scythians”— “where?” he inquired again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He carried the letter and the album with the books, and when they came, they sat beside the piano and the other day had occasion to observe the crooked way they all got into the room when the pianist was away. The piano was, of course, a permanent, sturdy machine, built in the old-fashioned, though not quite correct, style, with solid, rectangular blocks of wood interrelated, like the arms and legs of a horse with its head bent, like an owl with its folded wings; and it was, on this same day, that the artist came, wrapped up in a pink silk wrapper, his face pale and sad, his thick, red fingers shaking slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She showed him the portfolio; it had been sold to her by her brother in Russia, he said. At the time when he moved to America he worked as a “meth merchant” in a big factory along the Rio Grande; and now, suddenly, he began to feel that he was moving permanently into a new country. The sky was already beginning to auburn, the damp earth was still in place, and it seemed that, for every hour of sunshine there produced in one spot a glistening mist that floated slowly over the heads of the darning machines. In the small hours of that night he happened to open as he passed another shop, and at the very second he noticed a little girl who sat, wrapped up in a pink paper fan, on the floor beside the shopworn piano. “Hello,” he said, kissing the fan and taking the money from the girl’s fingers. “It’s me,” the fan replied. “You’re a big brother now?”\n",

      "A boy of twelve or so, neatly dressed in an elaborate first-class dressing gown, with an ample head and piercing blue eyes, came up close to him and asked modest preliminary questions about the other shopkeeper and the person with the large face. The boy’s father, an old acquaintance of the shopkeeper, gave the boy’s mother money in the form of a small check for an item of which he had bought a cake at an Easter party for which he had made a gift to the family of a cousin of the shopkeeper; for this small purchase, with\n",

      " with a great book. His life in general, as I saw it, was a happy, healthy adventure. I myself could not stand his society, but after the disaster of his love affair with Claudia, I soon forgot the idea of his being a lunatic. On the day of the wedding to Maria Erika Fischer, however, everything changed. We were living in St. Petersburg at that time—and at that time everything did not work out so well. On one occasion, just before his engagement to Maria, which was already announced in everything—her works, the Kremlin, her daily life in general—I noticed that his mood was already affected by an unexpected turn of events. Just as a man who has just lost a valuable object suddenly finds it incredibly difficult to put it to the use of his imagination, so too we too were confronted by the same loss, to paraphrase Pushkin’s hero’s words in “The Stormy Chilly Weather.” I felt my bloody, beautiful heart pounding, and I asked myself with a smile how far we had to step, how much farther we had to travel—if in Europe at all …”\n",
      "\n",
      "In November of that year, at the hour when the famine had put an end to any hopes of his going on tour—and this was just to mention the main thing—a conversation with another companion confirmed to him—no, that is not it—that our fate in Russia was sealed shut, that our fate was absolutely impenetrable, and that from time to time a storm of famines struck the country, and that our only hope was to starve to death. On the other side of the question, at the other end of the globe, there still existed in Russia, in exile, millions of anxious, thoughtful people, of every age, of every nationality, every walk of life. We met once, for example, in Istanbul, and after that such a steady bearing, with such a certain familiarity and quiet dignity of demeanor, that it was not surprising to us that those same people had listened to the charming tales of a certain eccentric poet, whom we had once heard telling about “the other Gospodin,” in a speech to the Military Committee of the Church. We lived in the same rooms, always together, and always in the same house, and even the same old Russian countryside, and the same old Russian folk songs—so we were like two people living side by side. We had the same dreams, the same strange feeling in our chests—but of course we were different people, our dreams were different, our mannerisms different. We traveled together, we traveled together. And then, one winter, fate took a turn for the worst—for it was not Claudia who was being spirited away … No, no, no, never! Not a single word of her was spoken with them, not a single thing occurred … She and her little boy friend, neither the child nor the woman were taken; she languished for three years in various hiding places, in a small izbasa … And then one day, in the middle of this years, fate did break … With dreadful regularity, fate had finished with her … For that day she was summoned by the General Security Committee and told to go into hiding. She did. And there were those who did not believe her—those who had already been following her around for a long time, those they knew to be true believers. I myself do not care to say how fate came to crush her, but it can hardly be otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "After her death, things got a little confusing—she had no son, or, more exactly, no brother, and her husband had no son either; he certainly would have met his wife. And then, too, there was that curious girl, the lanky, short, silent, pale little thing, who always wore black, sometimes with a short skirt, always had a long pigtail, could make out her back through her dress … But it seemed as if she had turned her back to people and had grown to resemble various monsters. So what if she had been a pretty, glamorous little beauty? In the meantime fate was already running over her—she would have been dragged away, she would be raped, and would again be plucked apart … Oh, not again!…\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the past has been put aside, we can proceed to the beginning. In the beginning I tried to put the events in perspective—and this too has become a tiresome business, that self-portrait of his. As I began to recall the days when he was a young man, to reminisce on all the trivialities that beset him in the world, I got lost in vague phrases and vague descriptions, and the vague things that used to tickle me made me think: “Oh, that explains everything, everything?” Then I would go back to the beginning, and once more would find the same things\n",

      "“So that’s how it is,” exclaimed Myrna Dmitrievna, and looking at the wall clock she counted aloud eight. Suddenly she raised her hand and, without looking at her hand, as if reciting, uttered a loud “Halt!” and stretched her arms. She stretched them as far as the door would go and, taking her time, made small elegant signals with her hand and began walking about the room, rubbing a little tablecloth occasionally with a slipper. On the edge of the desk sat a yellow volume of Chekhov, in which, in a few badly scrawled words, Russian letters were scrawled in lipstick-soft strokes. There was a framed photograph of a beheaded Russian academic in a head scarf. In one corner of the room, a mirror, full of reflections, half a head higher than the next, reflected Pavel Romanovich, reclicking through a begrimed black briefcase. His partner in the painting—a dull-looking elderly lady—sat with her back to the door, studying the facets of the portrait. Her hand, as she bent back her hand, spread out a faint hand: she had a thick slender finger, and her thumbs resembled the painted cherubim in some fresco of the sixties. As she did this, she kept a look of stern concentration—and then suddenly burst into a sobs and passed into unconsciousness.\n",

      "Miushevski came out of his chair with an open suitcase, and presently we parted, never to meet again. I have frequently thought that this is the moment when “the general panic” (where he at once confused the spontaneous with the deliberate) would cause a large group of people to gather in a secluded corner of a public park, and commune spontaneously (“screaming in one ear,” as Yasha used to say) over some delicious hors d’oeuvres. But such gatherings rarely happened. Once I entered a pleasant but not particularly clean house; but even so a dampish smell came from the open refrigerator.\n",

      "In the passage leading out of the house I passed a man with a suitcase; he carried it with him and walked up and down, pressing a hand-operated tricycle to his side. I thought I saw him trying to fit the corner of his suitcase with his body, but I did not catch the name of his victim. Turning in by turns, I passed a curious looking-glass whose display was limited to its own reflection.\n",

      "In general the Šme, or at least the first syllable, of any given person was not particularly pleasing. I found it surprising that a word and two words did not sufficiently coincide in pronunciation to form an accent, and that a word in the middle of the mouth and a syllable at the end could not be shaped into a question mark. The most difficult word, by far the loudest, was pryd, which sounded as if it had just been spoken aloud. I went back in order to my little island of comfort where I had glimpsed the name of my friend yet twice as many times as I had trod on the path that leads to this house. It was called Krush, and I recognized it immediately: it occurred once, sometimes, in the middle of a phrase. I went on asking along the corridor every day whether Krush had any connections with the security services. The last straw was when I realized that no one took him seriously, or, if he did, why was it so difficult to make a connection? And then there was the matter of his clothes. Yes, he was well dressed, white shirt, blue jeans, crisp tie. But the tie was frayed and frayed again. What about the question mark—had I not counted too many times? Oh yes, yes. Yes.\n",

      "As I was trying to unravel a knot that I was pulling in the lock of my suitcase, I noticed from the doorway that some work was lying at my feet. I pushed it away from me, and thought I had at last succeeded in convincing myself that this was the author of the note. I returned to my comfortable chair, which had been transformed into a sun-dappled armchair by the door, and began reading, very workily. A new letter arrived, addressed to me in an unfamiliar hand, but perfectly clear in my ear\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Budet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No answer needed,\" he replied, putting down his napkin and thrusting his hand into his pocket.\n",

      "\"But what was that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense—I told him,' I said. 'A nervous man's nervous. It is something that is hard to explain to a child. He was lying in bed and suddenly a car went into a curve.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a car?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. In a car. There he was, back in Paris. We went out to lunch. Everybody was silent at table. And after dinner he and I went out to dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made his way to a small cinema opposite our hotel and we sat for a quiet hour or so on the small terrace, waiting. He put down his napkin on the threshold of the restaurant, then looked at me and said, 'I'm not used to you talking too much. Well, let's see what I can do about it. I like to chat in the daytime with a man who is always so hungry.'\n",
      "\n",
      "I smiled quietly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The fact is that when he came home he proceeded to make a good mess of things, which he placed at the foot of his bed, immediately, before he went to bed. I saw that and tried to assist him. He was a blacksmith; he had got drunk about five years ago, was clean, clean now, like a dog—but he did not give a damn about anything now, did not know what he was doing to himself when he drank—and I tried to be kind to him. His father married again, he had a son and a little girl, was an old, old man, no doubt. The young artist in whom I recognized a certain likeness had been sick for a long time. So did his wife, both of them, excepting one,—yes, that was the other: she had a house to herself and had been married to a blacksmith for a long time, and had now toiling away in the field as a school nurse, had gone home to another husband, the husband of a child-carer, for a long time now — ten years — and there he was in Paris with a man from his own family, and his name, but of old, had seemed to be quite a stranger to her,—so much so that she felt bound to ask him what was wrong with her, what prevented her from sitting here and talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had some fun today,\" he said in his strange Russian. \"It was a great relief. The first day of spring in Europe, I say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was in May. It had all begun on the third, when he and I were walking along an imaginary beach near Nice (they had come all the way from England once or twice to see me — because I told you you could expect me). He and I were walking in the direction of our flat when we noticed a man with a great big moustache turn out on the street who had been drinking for a long time and who now, through an onerous rattle, was rocking back and forth on the sidewalk. I told him I was expecting him. He did not answer any questions. He carried a handbook, in which was a copy of Proud Britain and a little piece of leaf paper, now torn.\n",

      "'How interesting,' said Fyodor Konstantinovich, 'these people.'\n",
      "\n",
      "We were about to go under his door when suddenly he let us in. It was a kind of open little courtyard, almost verisimilar to other flats it had not previously rented. The kitchen was still aflame. Fyodor was clad in the latest frock coat of his tight-fitting blue jeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What to do next?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Next I'm afraid, to answer your question. The main thing now is to get dressed and get ready for work. I'm afraid I have no time before me.\"\n",

      "I found it strange to notice his blank, absent-minded expression at work, or perhaps it was merely a blank that wished to be filled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the same I am very happy for you,\" I continued, \"but I'm having a very slow start on the writing because I need a whole week to compose, as a lawyer needs a whole week to compose anything in the world, and the other thing here is the writing\n",
